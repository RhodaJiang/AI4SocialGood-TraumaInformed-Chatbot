Mitak was under the care of his aunt after leaving Bangladesh at a young age due to domestic violence. By the time he reached his teens, the relationship with his aunt was at breaking point and Mitak was kicked out at 16. He was placed with a foster family for two years before securing housing and being referred to Centrepoint for floating support. Today Mitak has self-published his own book about his experience growing up and has set up his own business.
Mitak remembers growing up with his aunt as a tempestuous period of his life.
“I didn’t have a lot of guidance growing up and my aunt didn’t really didn’t care about what was going on in my life. Most of my friends didn’t know what I was going through without my parents around. I found it hard to focus at school. I wanted to be a kid and to enjoy my childhood, but had to mature very quickly and think about adult things from a very early age.”
When Mitak was thrown out of his aunt’s home, he slept rough for about two days and then stayed with a friend for a few weeks which is when he approachedNew HorizonsYouth Centre. They put him in touch withCoram Voicewho found him legal help and advocated for Mitak by challenging the local borough’s decision to return Mitak to his aunt’s home; a place Mitak describes as very damaging.
“It made me feel rubbish because I had to go through everything again. I was thinking, do I really have to do this to be heard and to explain all the details as to why I’m not okay," he reflects.
The legal case went on for a month or two and it was eventually decided that Mitak should be placed with a foster family.
“I’ve always had the sense that I don’t belong. Going to that house, I felt very low. The lowest I’d ever felt. For the first week, I felt very out of place; that I was living in strangers. I didn’t want to come downstairs. After a week, I gathered the courage to speak to them and try to get to know them which helped.”
Mitak stayed with the family for about 7 months before moving into semi-independent housing when he reached 18.
“It took me back to square one again because suddenly I had to pretty much fend for myself completely: cook, clean, pay bills and I was clueless.”
Mitak received floating support from Centrepoint which helped provide him with the skills he needed to become independent.
"Shiblu (my support worker) really got me through. I think I would have been lost without him. He really guided me. I was very ambitious and I always wanted to do a lot of things and Shiblu really helped me understand which path I wanted to take and to give me the direction to do it. He introduced me to The Prince’s Trust which helped me to start up my business. I’ve been writing a book since I was 14: my life story and he was the one that really encouraged me to get it published.”
“Having the support from Centrepoint, helped me to put my life back together. For young vulnerable people like me, understanding who is there for us, who we can trust is difficult because we’re used to being completely on our own." he says. "Having Shiblu there, someone I could trust and speak to when things went wrong really helped me to get back on my feet. It was slow progress, but it worked in the long term. Now I’m able to do everything for myself now; I’m very independent and doing really well," he enthuses.
Recently, Mitak has been working with Billy Harding from Centrepoint’spolicy teamas part of a peer research group of former and current residents who are conducting research aroundUniversal Creditand vulnerable young people.
“Our research has shown that there isn’t enough support for young people, especially vulnerable young people. The benefits system has a one-size fits all approach. A vulnerable young person is treated the same as everyone else rather than having a different department deal with you because you are in a much more vulnerable situation. Work coaches aren’t trained to understand your vulnerabilities. For instance, my work coach didn’t understand that I had no parents and that I was living by myself in supported accommodation.”
“People don’t realise how much some young people carry on their shoulders and on top of that, to pay bills and rent and hold down a job; it can be incredibly challenging. Also for a young person with no support, it’s much harder to get the qualifications they need to move forward and get the job they want. They need more support to get those qualifications”
Mitak has been running his own digital marketing business since 2018. He’s self-published a book on Amazon and is in the process of writing more.
“Things are going really well for me at the moment and I am trying to write part two of my book. Writing allows me to be myself. It’s an escape for me. I got into writing because I didn’t have any other way to deal with my mental health. All the mental health support didn’t really help me, but writing did. I needed an outlet, a release so I started writing at 13. With my book,Mitak’s Incomplete,I don’t really know how I did it. It started off as a diary about my past and what I was going through and being separated from my mother. And then my journey from the old to the new me. It followed me from 13 up until 19. It showed how my perspective changed and so on.”
We are so proud of Mitak’s resilience and resourcefulness and have no doubt that he will achieve his goals. Well done Mitak!

002 - Carrianne's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/carriannes-story-centrepoint-saved-me

Helpline0808 800 0661
Carrianne came to London in search of her father in 1983 at just 15-years-old. She met two punks in Soho who told her about the Centrepoint night shelter. She lied about her age to get in and stayed there for two weeks whilst they helped to find her father. Today, Carrianne has three adult children and one grandchild, lives in Devon and is a keen surfer, horse rider and boxer.
In 1983, following a breakdown in the relationship with her mother and stepfather, Carrianne ran away to London in search of her father. She was just 15 years old and hadn’t seen him since she was five. She had no idea of his address or where she was going.
“I was really troubled and unhappy at home. I had run away a couple of times previously and slept rough, but this time I wanted to find my Dad. I ran away with my little blue vanity case. I thought I knew exactly what I was doing at the time, but I was incredibly naïve. I just didn’t have a clue. I had no idea how I was going to find my father as I had no details for him at all.”
Luckily, on the first night that she arrived in London, Carrianne was befriended by some punks in Leicester Square.
“They must have noticed that I was vulnerable and they took me for something to eat at McDonalds,” she remembers. “I only had about £10 to my name. I told them I was 17 and that I had come to London to look for work. They told me about the Centrepoint night shelter in Soho which is where they were staying.”
“I remember a gate and there was a woman with a clipboard and I had to fill out some forms. I lied about my age. I remember being there and feeling looked after. We had to leave in the day time, but would come back to sleep there and I was there for about a fortnight.”
Carrianne remembers that the staff at Centrepoint were amazing and made her feel safe. After two weeks, she was called into the office and they told her that the British Transport Police had found her father, who worked on the underground. They took her to Paddington Station where she met her father for the first time in ten years.
She lived with her father and his wife for about six months, but the relationship fell apart and Carrianne went back to the Midlands where she was placed in care as her mother and stepfather refused to have her back.
This was an extremely difficult time of her life.
“That year when I was 15-16 was the worst of my life, but if it wasn’t for Centrepoint and those friendly punks, I really don’t know what would have happened to me.”
“When I see your posts come up on social media, I say to my husband that I am so passionate about the work you do because it did save me. I could have ended up anywhere and anything could have happened and thanks to you it didn’t. It’s a really strong memory for me, being safe and supported in that hostel.”
Carrianne no longer has a relationship with her mother or father, but says she leads a happy life.
Today, aged 55, she is a mother of three adult children and a grandmother to one. She lives in Devon and she is a keen surfer, horse rider and amateur boxer.
“I’ve just done a charity fight aged 55,” she laughs.  “I have a great life, we spend all our time on the beach and I can wait to teach my grandson to surf better than his nanny.”
What an amazing woman! We are so pleased we could be there for her when she was in need all those years ago.

003 - Kyle's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/kyles-story-streets-stability

Helpline0808 800 0661
Following a family breakdown at 18, Kyle ended up on the streets and has battled with homelessness and substance use since. With support from Centrepoint's Homelessness Prevention and Relief Service (HPRS) in Manchester, Kyle is now in his own permanent accommodation through Housing First. He has put drugs behind him and is on the path to securing stable employment.
Kyle became homeless in 2015 following a family breakdown and since then he has bounced between hostels, hotels and the streets.
“Rough sleeping was the main reason I turned to drugs – I couldn’t sleep out there. Drugs were like a curtain to shut everything out,” Kyle admits. “This meant that trying to keep myself stable was really challenging.”
Clove, Centrepoint’s Rough Sleeping Coordinator, was one of the first people Kyle had contact with at Centrepoint. This was before the pandemic. She provided him with his initial assessment and maintained contact during her outreach work.
During COVID-19, and the government’s Everyone In initiative, the hotels and hostels that Kyle were placed in had strict rules about guests and where he could go. Kyle said this could have felt isolating, but it actually benefitted his situation – he couldn’t associate with people that may negatively influence him.
“I was indoors and not allowed to leave the building except to go to the garden, so I used it as an opportunity to get off drugs,” he reflects.
“In late 2021, a few years after Clove had first assessed me, she walked past me whilst I was on the streets. She said, ‘Kyle, I’m your case worker, whenever you need me come find me’.”
For Clove, it’s important to make it clear to the young person that you are there for them when they need you, but not to push. “Sometimes it can take months or even years to build up that trust with them. They need to be ready to accept help and you need to meet them where they are without judgement,” she says.
For Kyle, that approach worked.
“I went into Centrepoint the next day and she referred me to Housing First [an evidence based model to support homeless people to live in their own home], which helped me eventually get the flat I’m in now.”
Centrepoint were also able to refer Kyle to one of their complex case workers Amy, who supported him with his mental health during some of the difficult transitions.
“If my head goes west, I know can talk to Amy. Whenever I need her, she is on the end of the phone.”
There was a moment when things did go downhill for Kyle and he relapsed. His friend died in his flat and he had to move. For Amy, it was so important to be there as a constant during this difficult period.
“The trauma of losing his friend meant he started rough sleeping and using again, but luckily he managed to pull himself out of it with our support - he attended Centrepoint nearly every single day during this time and we helped him plan a memorial, which helped with the healing process.”
With continuous support from Centrepoint, Kyle is back in stable accommodation. The last piece of the jigsaw was getting Kyle back into work.
For Kyle, one of the hardest things about sleeping rough was being unable to work. It felt like a vicious cycle: the one thing that might help him find stability was impossible to maintain whilst in that situation.
“I’ve always enjoyed working and I wanted to be in work,” he says. “However, when it comes to applications and job interviews, writing down ‘no fixed abode’ doesn’t work in your favour. You can’t get a job if you’ve got no address and no ID.”
TheCentrepoint Works teamhelped Kyle to apply for new ID so that he can gain employment training with one of Centrepoint’s training partners, The Pret Foundation. Their Rising Stars programme provides people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness with everything they need to get back into employment, from training, to uniform, to support groups, travel and food.
Ben, the CP Works trainer in Manchester was instrumental in this process.
“If it weren’t for Ben, I wouldn’t be on this programme with Pret. Ben has done health and safety, food safety and helped me sort all my documents so I am now ready to be trained on the job in the shops. It’s been brilliant,” says Kyle.
Ben has been really impressed with Kyle’s attitude and the way he’s approached the training.
“Kyle was a star student, always turned up early, and was knowledgeable and enthusiastic throughout the course. He is great at building a rapport with people, which is one of the reasons why I think he will do very well."
Although Kyle found the Rising Stars programme really helpful and learnt a lot, he has since decided to move into construction and is currently doing his CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) training through Lifeshare. After which, he should be able to start work in the construction industry.
“I’m really excited about getting back into work. Working again has made me feel really motivated and excited about doing things again.”
Without Centrepoint’s support, Kyle believes he wouldn’t be where he is now.
“Centrepoint have helped me with so much. They’ve been an amazing. I couldn’t ask for anything else. They have been like a family to me.”
And Kyle’s advice to others?
“Accept help when it’s there because it might not always be there.”
We think Kyle has made incredible progress and we wish him all the best for his future.

004 - Dee's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/dees-story-centrepoint-helpline-was-lifeline-me

Helpline0808 800 0661
Dee was supported over a number of weeks by the Centrepoint Helpline who advocated on her behalf. A few months later, Dee is living in temporary accommodation in a studio flat, has been assessed as priority need and can start bidding on properties. This means that she is able to start “rebuilding her life.”
For two long years, Dee, 25, had been sofa surfing, fleeing domestic violence from a family member who still harassed her. Her housing case with the local authority seemed to be going nowhere, and she felt as if she was fighting an uphill battle.
“I reached out to the Centrepoint Helpline when I was at an all-time low,” Dee recalled. “I felt lost, my morale was shattered, and I was desperate for help. I’d read stories on the website of others who had been helped and it felt relatable so I gave them a call.”
Dee's mental health challenges—anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)—combined with her physical health issues, including severe Crohn’s disease, Reynaud’s disease, endometriosis, and dermatitis, made her situation even more daunting. The instability of her housing was exacerbating her distress.
Hannah, one of Centrepoint’s Helpline Advisors took Dee’s call. “It’s my job to help young people like Dee navigate this challenging process,” Hannah said. “It was clear when I talked to her that she was in distress and needed an advocate.”
Hannah contacted the Housing Options team on Dee’s behalf to enquire about her case. The response was not what they had hoped - the housing officer was still investigating whether Dee was deemed ‘homeless’ and had therefore not yet triggered the necessary interim accommodation process under Section 188 of the Housing Act. They were still trying to assess whether she was in priority need for housing.
After that, days passed with little contact from her housing officer, leaving Dee feeling increasingly frustrated, but Hannah continued to advocate on her behalf. “I followed up with Dee’s housing officer,” Hannah explains. “I wanted to ensure Dee got the help she needed. She continued to rely on the Out of Hours service for housing support. However, the shared toilet facilities and lack of private space further exacerbated and amplified the symptoms of her condition.” As Dee further explains, “The conditions in the Out of Hours service and the way I was talked to by the staff there made me feel suicidal. I felt like I was trying to eat soup with a fork.”
As her distress grew, so did the weight of her financial situation. Living on just £115 a week from sick pay left Dee struggling to eat. Hannah stepped in again, applying for an emergency food voucher that brought a glimmer of relief. “That support made a huge difference,” Dee explains “I felt so grateful.”
Dee faced further setbacks at the council office, where she encountered rude staff who told her she was not a priority. “They even said I couldn’t charge my phone there!” she exclaimed, shaking her head. “I felt like I was being pushed away.”
However, Hannah assured Dee that they would keep pursuing her case. “She continued to liaise with the Out of Hours service and Dee’s housing officer.
Eventually, hope began to emerge. The Housing Options team contacted Dee to inform her that they had agreed to provide temporary accommodation. “It felt like a huge weight had been lifted and started to feel much more supported by my housing officer.” Dee said.
Hannah guided Dee through the necessary paperwork, understanding that her ADHD made tasks like this challenging. “I could not have done it without her help,” Dee admitted. “Hannah really took the time to explain everything and made sure I felt comfortable.”
When the accommodation was confirmed, Dee felt a sense of empowerment she hadn’t experienced in a long time. “I cannot begin to express my gratitude for the outstanding support I received from Centrepoint,” she said. “When I first turned reached out to the Centrepoint Helpline, I felt like I was fighting a losing battle. The world seemed to be closing in on me, and I was desperate for help. From the moment I reached out, I encountered nothing but empathy, compassion, and warmth.”
Reflecting on her journey, Dee shared, “Even though I still face many uncertainties, I now feel equipped to handle whatever comes my way, thanks to Hannah's support. I aspire to create such a meaningful impact in the lives of others as Hannah did in mine.”
As Dee continued her journey towards stability, she couldn’t help but feel hopeful. “Thank you, Hannah, for being my hero,” she said with a smile. “And thank you, Centrepoint, for providing me with the support I needed to rebuild my life.”
Dee is currently living in emergency accommodation in a studio flat with her cat, Andrew, and she has her own kitchen and bathroom. She has also been told that she is in priority need of housing so can start bidding on properties. Dee has a keen interest in interior design and has really enjoyed decorating and furnishing her flat. “I have a really keen eye for finding amazing free things online or that people leave on the street,” she says. “I have found some lovely piece of furniture for my space and it gives me such a sense of satisfaction.”
Dee is about to complete her bricklaying apprenticeship and says that Hannah has even made that more attainable for her.
“Hannah referred me to an organisation called STAR Thames Reach. I have a case worker there who has helped fund a taxi to college for the remaining six weeks of my apprenticeship. I find timekeeping a challenge at times due to my neurodivergence and this means that I am always on time and I can ensure I complete it. There are lots of things in my life that I haven’t finished and that has impacted my confidence. Recently, I’ve realised that I am not stupid and I can achieve things.”
Because her housing situation is resolved, Dee says she can stop living in a constant state of anxiety and begin to focus on getting her health and career back on track. “I don’t feel like I have to firefight anymore,” she explains. If it wasn’t for Hannah, Dee doesn’t think she would be in the position she is in now. "I owe Hannah so much. She was so patient with me. I’m a really sensitive person and really respond to how someone talks to me. I can easily disengage if I feel like the person isn’t genuine and authentic and listening to me. It felt like Hannah really cared and really wanted to make a difference. Having someone want to advocate me make me want to advocate for myself.”
With your support, we can answer even more calls and give young people, just like Dee, the care and advice they need to have stable housing and a bright future.

005 - Kyla's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/kylas-story-bad-times-will-pass

Helpline0808 800 0661
Kyla sought help from Centrepoint in 2018 when she was at breaking point after her baby son was adopted. The team in Manchester supported her with drug and alcohol counselling, mental health support and securing housing and benefits. Four years later, Kyla is in her own home, in the second year of university and teetotal. Here is her story in her own words.
I sought help from Centrepoint’s Homeless Prevention and Relief Service (HPRS) in Manchester in August 2018 when I found myself at breaking point.
I was going through an extremely difficult time. My son had just been adopted and I had been in a violent relationship. After that, I went off the rails. I had to leave my flat for having parties, which left me homeless. I was luckily enough able to sleep on the floor of friends flat. I stayed there for seven weeks. I knew that I needed help finding my own home, and my friend who I was staying with told me all about Centrepoint. This was when I sought out help and did an assessment in their office in Manchester.
Centrepoint were so supportive. They helped me move in to temporary accommodation. They supported me through with a court case with my son (appeal of the adoption), with managing bills, applying for Universal Credit and emotional support. When I first moved in, I was drinking many nights to mask the pain. I knew my life was better but I was still heartbroken from the loss of my son. Centrepoint offered me counselling and drug and alcohol support which helped me a tremendous amount. It took a lot of hard work and determination to stop drinking, but I did it! I have been teetotal for over two years – I couldn’t have done that without Centrepoint.
I spent a long time angry with social services and the courts for taking away my son. I didn’t think it was fair. But looking back now, he wouldn’t have been safe in that situation. I have come to realise now that if my son had come home with me from the hospital after his birth, I couldn’t have given him everything that he has now, a stable and happy home and two loving parents. I am really happy that my son is thriving in a safe, warm home with many people around that love him very much.
Every year I get a letter from his adoptive parents and every Christmas I write back to him. He’s too young now, but one day he will get the chance to read those letters. Social services seem to have found the perfect match for him. He is in a musical family. His adoptive mother plays piano and he sits next to her singing, which of course make me smile lots. I look forward to the day when we might meet, but until then, I just wish him and his adoptive parents all the happiness and joy.
I am thankful to all the people who supported me. My life could have been very different without their support. I’m very happy now and managing financially. I recently moved out of temporary housing (that was offered to me from Centrepoint back in 2018), and into my own flat, which is safe and secure. I have managed to finish a music course at college and I am now in my second year at University studying Popular Music and Recording.
My love of music really started when I was eight-years-old and I started African drumming and singing lessons. I built up a really good relationship with the teacher and she really inspired me to pursue my love of playing and singing.  Eventually, I would like to become a music teacher and open my own music school. Right now,  I am just loving my course at university – I love how creating music helps me to relax and stay on the right path.
I feel like my life is in a good place now and I would never have imagined I would be where I am at now, four years ago. I am so grateful that Centrepoint were there when I needed them. The staff there were amazing and I was lucky to have their support.
To other young people in similar situations, I would say, keep going, don’t give up – the bad times will pass.
We are so pleased that we could be there for Kyla when she needed us most and we are so impressed with how she has moved her life forwards.

006 - Aysar's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/aysars-story-finding-acceptance-and-confidence-centrepoint

Helpline0808 800 0661
Aysar became homeless after his family found out about a same-sex relationship. Centrepoint have supported Aysar with his mental health and finding employment. He hopes to move into his own accommodation soon.
Growing up, Aysar, (20), was subject to abuse both at school and within the family.
When he was 16, he built up the courage to open up to his parents about the things he’d experienced, but they didn’t believe him and instead of supporting him, they suggested that he should end his own life if he was going to say such things about his family. Soon afterwards, lockdown happened and he had no choice but to live through it in the family home. He remembers it being one of the most difficult periods of his life.
In 2023, Aysar's family discovered that he was having a sexual relationship with another man. His parents presented him with an ultimatum:  either live at home or continue with the relationship. Aysar decided that he had no choice, but to leave.
With support from his case worker from the AKT (Albert Kennedy Trust) who advocated for him, Aysar was assessed by the housing office in the area and found emergency accommodation. From there he was placed in his own accommodation. However, just a month or so later, he was told he had to leave because the housing benefit didn’t cover his rent. He is under 25 and gets a lower rate of housing benefit.
“That period was so frustrating,” he remembers. “I had just set up all my bills and mail at the new address and started to settle again and the rug was pulled from under me. I felt completely lost and didn’t have the time to process everything that was happening. I don’t feel I was given accurate information by people. My physical and mental health was in a really bad place.”
The local authority referred Aysar to Centrepoint where he has been since July of 2023.
Since being at Centrepoint, Aysar says he has finally had the headspace to put himself back together and start to learn the skills necessary to stand on his own two feet. He has also been able to access support from one of Centrepoint’s dedicated psychotherapists, Amrita, to work through some of his trauma. He says this has been invaluable and has helped him to trust again.
Amrita has been so impressed with his progress.
“When Aysar first presented to thepsychotherapy service, he felt lost, confused and scared," she says. "He struggled to express his thoughts and feelings, and to take care of his own needs due to feeling undeserving and guilty for doing so. However, in counselling, Aysar has embraced the idea of being vulnerable so that he could begin to heal. Though his sense of self-worth had been severely shattered through the difficulties that he suffered, he has begun to see himself as worthy of love, respect, happiness and more. Aysar has started to find his voice and has grown so much. It’s been a privilege to witness him on this journey.”
Aysar has also been able to access support from one ofCentrepoint’s JET (jobs, education and training)advisors. With their support, he is now on a pre-apprenticeship with Yorkshire Housing and eventually wants to go on to do an electrical apprenticeship.
Michelle, Aysar’s JET worker says,
“I made contact with Yorkshire Housing who were willing to start working with Centrepoint to offer young people pre-apprenticeship support to get them ready to apply for the next intake in September 2024. Aysar attended a volunteer day and was one of the few selected to shadow operatives for a week in early 2024. Aysar will hopefully get a chance to speak with some of the recruitment managers with a view to apply and hopefully from there, be offered an apprenticeship starting in September 2024.”
Aysar is excited about this opportunity and wants to do his very best in order to secure the apprenticeship.
“I’ve always liked hands on stuff. I couldn’t be stuck in an office all day," he explains.
Aysar also recently completed assertiveness training through the CP Works team that really helped him know his own mind.
“I feel I have the strength to make my own decisions and the headspace to achieve things again. I’m  making the most of what Centrepoint have to offer so I can get back on my feet.”
Aysar says that since being at Centrepoint, he feels both supported and heard and that he has developed a range of skills: in particular assertiveness and confidence.
His whole outlook and self view have shifted. As he explains,
“Linzi, one of the staff at Centrepoint said to me, ‘Life shrinks or expands according to your courage.’ It’s really stuck with me and I’m trying to live by that.
Aysar is hoping to move into his own place soon. He says, “I’m working with Ruth from Centrepoint’s rent deposit scheme to find something appropriate, hopefully through Yorkshire Housing.”
We wish Aysar all the best with his endeavours.

007 - Jahzyah's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/jahzyahs-story-something-good-going-happen-and-you-should-be

Helpline0808 800 0661
Jahzyah, 20, moved to a Centrepoint home two years ago after being in and out of the care system from the age of four. He’s recently been accepted into the Identity School of Acting and is currently waiting for to hear from the council to move into his own accommodation.
Jahzyah, 20, was first moved into care at the age of four when social workers became aware that he was living in an abusive, unstable and unsafe household. After being placed into care, he was moved around between different care and foster homes for years, before finding a home with a family for a longer than expected.
“I was taken into the foster care system at the age of 4 because I came from an abusive household. From there I bounced around from care home to care home, and I was abused a few times in care as well. On the fourth or fifth care home, it actually ended up being my longest stay”.
He stayed with this family for around six years and developed a close relationship with the whole family, a relationship that he still holds close to him.
“I ended up staying there close to six years and I actually still call those people mum and dad to this day. They genuinely didn’t treat me like I was a foster care kid. They treated me like I was one of their children and I had sleepovers at their children’s places with their grandchildren and I called them cousins because we were the same age”.
He remembers getting to try out new activities with them like learning to swim and joining a local ice hockey team as well as going on family holidays to Devon and Cornwall. However, after six years they weren’t able to take care of him anymore and he was moved back into the care system.
From here, he was moved around a couple of different homes, all whilst going to college and trying to find his feet. At 18, he was given the option to remain in care, where he would lose a lot of the support he was receiving or move into supported accommodation.
“I just felt like I’m already quite an independent person and so the best move for me would be to go into supported housing and keep the support there just in case I need it. And then I would have more opportunity going forward then I would have had it I had remained and that’s how I ended up being sent to Centrepoint”.
When Jahzyah first arrived at Centrepoint, he was moved to a high-support service, where the support staff could assess what level of guidance he might need to live independently. Whilst living with his foster family, Jahzyah had been able to grow a lot of independent skills, which meant that he felt ready to look after himself.
“The family I stayed with they were very diligent in making sure I knew how to look after myself. From the age of 11 I was cooking and cleaning and doing my own laundry and everything. They made sure that I had those skills, so it wasn’t particularly difficult for me to adjust to living on my own”.
Before too long, Jahzyah was moved from the high-support service into the accommodation he is in now.
Whilst living there, he’s really enjoyed the opportunity to get involved in lots of different activities from Christmas parties and barbecues to visiting museums and galleries. “I remember going on a trip to the Science Museum which was pretty fun because I really like science”.
He says that they frequently run cookery classes at the house, which is something he loves to get involved with. At school he was able to get his Level 2 Food Production Qualification, so he’s been able to help other residents learn some basic cooking skills during those sessions. “If I’m in the mood, I can help out if someone needs it. Everything from like deboning a chicken and cutting it up or if someone is struggling to cut an onion, I’ll show them how to properly dice it and just stuff like that”.
From a young age, Jahzyah was always pushed towards doing science and whilst he was at school he really thought that this was what he was going to pursue. “I grew up being told I was smart, and I got decently good grades. I was constantly being told to get a good job and become a doctor or a leading scientist.”
However, growing up he saw his grandad starring in films from Marvel movies to comedy blockbusters and this instilled a passion for acting from childhood. “My grandad on my mum’s side used to be an actor and growing up whenever I got to see him, he always had some sort of story of what he would see on set or the people he would meet. It always seemed so fun – getting to travel for work it just seemed like such a big benefit because I’ve never really been able to go to other countries and that really appeals to me”.
For Jahzyah it was a huge realisation that he wanted to take his life in the direction that felt right for him rather than what had been expected of him. “I came to the realisation that I hadn’t given the time to think about what I really wanted to do in my life and whether science was something that I wanted to continue with. I stopped to think about what I wanted to do with my life, and I realised I wanted to try out being an actor”.
To support him with pursuing acting, he was referred to the CP Works team who helped him to identify internships or apprenticeships to get him one step closer to his goal. With that in mind, Hannah, a Centrepoint training and jobs advisor, found and helped him onto a placement with the National Theatre.
Whilst there, he was able to get his name down for an audition with the prestigious Identity School of Acting, an award-winning part-time drama school based in Brixton. If successful in his audition Jahzyah might then be able to join their impressive alumni list including Damson Idris, John Boyega, Regé-Jean Page and Letitia Wright.
Before too long, Jahzyah had his audition but was unsure about how it went and felt worried about what the next step might be. “Having such an open script was a bit of trouble for me to play. I thought I didn’t do quite as well as I could have, and I was so nervous about whether or not I might get in”.
However, only a couple of hours later, they emailed to him to say that he had been accepted. He was so excited that he got in and ran out to tell his support workers as soon as he could. “I was just scrolling on my phone and the notification popped up. I literally ran out of my room in my pyjamas, like I didn’t even bother getting changed or anything. I immediately just burst out of my room and had to let them know I got in”.
When asked about his dream role, he knows exactly what character he would want to play. “My dream role would be a live action of the Disney film Tarzan. I relate a lot to Tarzan, at least growing up. It was like this guy looks like me when I had longer black braids and we have the same build as well”.
“Not only does Tarzan look like me but I can relate to him as well. Especially because I went through foster care where I had that feeling of knowing that my real parents were out there, but I couldn’t go and see them when I was bouncing from place to place, just like Tarzan. You know he’s with the gorillas and he doesn’t quite fit in with the gorillas, but he makes do with what he’s got and kind of figures it out”.
Jahzyah is currently waiting to hear from the council on when he can move into his own flat. He looks back on his experiences of staying with Centrepoint and recognises how living independently but with support on hand helped him to be ready for moving on. “I’m grateful for the experience of technically living on my own, but while still having the support in place”.
“I’ve prepared for things as best I can now, and I’ve been living semi-independently for two years and I just need to get used to do living independently. It’s just the next natural step”.
He’s looking forward to beginning his classes with the Identity School of Acting and the opportunities that might come from working together, especially roles that might help him to travel the world. At the same time, he’s been looking for jobs that would give him the flexibility to take on auditions and Hannah has been helping him to understand his options.
He has some advice for young people who might be facing similar challenges that helped him through his own experiences. “My advice would be just don’t get too hung up on things. Bad things will happen, but in the same way, good things will also happen and if you just keep pushing on and keep moving forward, then eventually something good is going to happen and you should be ready for it”.
We are so immensely proud of Jahzyah’s incredible achievements, and we hope that his upcoming housing review gives him the outcome he deserves. We can’t wait to see him on the big screen soon!
With your help, young people like Jahzyah won't miss out on life changing opportunities that will help to shape their futures.

008 - Joe's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/joes-story-leaving-rough-sleeping-behind

Helpline0808 800 0661
Joe was supported by Centrepoint in Manchester on and off over a number of years, but it’s only recently that Joe has been ready to turn his life around. From sleeping in every doorway in Manchester City Centre, Joe is now in a stable place and looking forward to the future.
Joe's childhood was punctuated by heartbreak and loss. By the age of 16 he had fallen into homelessness, drugs and crime.
“The trauma of my childhood meant that I fell into drugs, youth offending and a dark place of homelessness.”
It can take a long time for someone to be in the right place to accept support and is dependent on a number of factors. For Joe, it’s taken seven years to get to that place.
Joe was first known to the Centrepoint’s rough sleeping team in Manchester when he was just 17 and they signposted him to services that could help him with his mental health and housing. He says that at that time, he was just living every day as it came in order to survive.
“I was rough sleeping on and off since a very young age. The drugs kept me on the streets. I was a heavy user and it was easier staying on the streets than being at home. Even though I was homeless myself, I looked after the other homeless people; making sure people had clean socks and were fed and watered and stuff like that. I slept in every single doorway in Manchester City Centre during the years I was homeless. I lost a few friends along the way to drugs and everything else.”
Eventually, Joe realised that he would die if he continued down this path.
“Two years ago, my father died of a heroin overdose. I’ve been through prison and mental health sections due to the state of my health. I realised I was tired of taking drugs and slowly dying. Centrepoint put me on the right path to healing myself both psychologically and emotionally."
With Centrepoint’s support, particularly from the complex case worker, Amy, he got help with his mental health and substance use and was able to get clean.
“Knowing that someone is on the end of the phone and that they are not going to give up on you is so important," Joe explains. "Centrepoint never gave up on me and were always there to talk to if I was in crisis. It was very encouraging to know that.”
Amy is so proud of the progress Joe has made.
“In the last six months Joe has really worked hard to turn his life around and it has been amazing to see his progress,” she remarks.
Without Centrepoint’s unwavering support, Joe says that he could be in quite a different place now.
“I think without Centrepoint and the support they offer, a lot of young people would slip through the cracks and go into a dark state of mental health issues or never leaving the streets,” he says. “Centrepoint offer young people a chance to turn things around. I wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for them and I am so grateful.”
Joe is now clean and living back in his family home. He is looking forwards to the future.
“I am in a very positive mindset now and I am not going to go back to the drugs. Centrepoint helped me to get to this place.”

009 - Layla's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/laylas-story-dreaming-stable-life

Helpline0808 800 0661
Layla became homeless at 18. She called the Centrepoint Helpline who were able to arrange an assessment with the Homeless Prevention and Relief Service (HPRS) in Manchester. She is now living in a self-contained flat and supported by Centrepoint’s Floating Support Team.
In the spring of 2023, Layla had a serious falling out with her mum over finances. She was working as a cleaner and despite already paying her share for her upkeep, her mum asked her for more money or threatened to throw her out.
“I knew my mum would spend it on drugs so I didn’t want to give it to her. I had hardly any money in my account and had been supporting her for a while. I didn’t want to enable her habit.”
For some time, Layla had been struggling with her mental health and the situation with her mum caused her to have a serious episode.
“I became so upset and angry; probably the angriest I’ve ever felt," she explains. "I told her that I would give her the money if I could see it was going on bills, but she wouldn’t make that promise. I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. I needed to get away from her because living with her was extremely damaging to my mental health. I was scared that I would cause harm to myself or my mum so I called the police and asked them to come and get me because I couldn’t control how I was feeling. I also thought about my brother who had just come out of care and I didn’t want something to happen to me which would mean I couldn’t be there for him. I only got him back in my life again a year ago.”
The police came and after Layla told them what had happened and took Layla to hospital.
The hospital then helped to secure her emergency accommodation for three nights and recommended she ring the Centrepoint Helpline to advise on longer-term support.
“TheHelplinereassured me and made me feel calm. They were able to get me an assessment with the HPRS team the same day which I couldn't believe."
Layla went to Centrepoint a couple of hours after her call and was seen by Rebecca, an HPRS worker, for an assessment.
“Rebecca was so helpful,” she remembers. “She was new in the role, but you'd never have known that and got me into emergency accommodation the same day and even stayed past closing to make sure I got settled. Once I was in the new accommodation, she phoned me regularly to make sure I was ok. She showed me how to get my benefits set up and then a week and a half later she got me into a hostel where I stayed for six weeks before they found me the flat I am in now.”
Rebecca says, “Layla was the first case I worked with start to finish and I’ve not yet come across another young person as proactive as she was in making sure her situation improved.”
Today, Layla is feeling a lot better. The flat she’s in is managed by Centrepoint and it’s in her home town so she’s nearer her friends and support network.
“I feel so lucky,” she reflects, “The flat is affordable, freshly painted and it’s the perfect size for me. I’ve been here three months now and I’ve settled in really nicely.”
Layla says she feels incredibly grateful for the support Centrepoint have provided.“It was really scary being in that position, but now I am doing so much better and I owe it all to Centrepoint’s support. The workers there were so good and broke down difficult to understand information which can be really overwhelming and just went above and beyond to help me.”
Wendy, Layla’s floating support worker says,
“I am supporting Layla around working towards independence and preparing her for her own tenancy in the future. When a young person has been supported into safer, suitable accommodation, the next steps are crucial in order to develop thosevital life skills.Floating Support provides these very important skills and tenancies would fail without such intervention with young people who have had unsettled and often traumatic lives.”
Layla confirms this, “I had no idea what I was going to do when I left my mums. I had no idea how to do anything, how to pay bills and rent. The staff at Centrepoint helped me sort my rent and learn how to budget. It can feel overwhelming, but with their support, it hasn’t felt so scary."
Although Layla is settled in her new place, she does struggle to make ends meet and often relies on food parcels from her floating support worker at Centrepoint.
“I lost my job after I was made homeless. They said that they couldn’t give me the hours, but I feel like it’s because I had to take time off after everything that happened due to the effect on my mental health and the fact I was living further away. It felt like it was just an excuse and I didn’t have the energy to fight it. It was just four weeks after I was made homeless. They knew my situation, but they still let me go.”
“I was really struggling with money at the time as I couldn’t cook in the temporary accommodation so was having to spend my money on takeaways and there were no decent shops nearby. I was in a hotel in the middle of nowhere. It meant that I had to get an advance on my Universal Credit, which I am still paying back. They take £40 out of my money each month, which is why I am struggling so much. They were taking £80, but I had to lower it as it was putting me in hardship.”
Layla is currently doing an employment access course where she will get help with her CVs and interviews. She hopes to get some bar or waitressing work and come off benefits.
“Although I am trying to get into work, I am currently on benefits and I barely get anything, I’m always feeling panicked about food and stuff wondering whether am I going to survive this month.  After I pay my phone bill. I’m left with about £100 for the month for food, travel, bills and everything else and everything has got so expensive. I remember multipack crisps were 65p in LIDL  and now they are £1. You don’t realise how bad it is until you live on your own.”
Layla’s hopes for the future are simple, as she explains, “I don’t want for much. I just want a stable comfortable life where I can make ends meet without worrying all the time.”
“It’s really important to me to be better than my mum was. I want to be there for my brother, I don’t want him left with no family. I want to be a better person. I’m now on meds for my mental health, I’m in my own flat. I’m trying to locate my child trust fund from HMRC so I can get driving lessons.”
Although Layla recognises her mum’s own trauma and how it impacted her behaviour, she’s adamant that she doesn’t want to go down the same path and instead wants to use her own trauma to propel her forwards.
“My mum kept saying to me that if she doesn’t sort herself out, she’s gonna die. What child wants to hear that? I understand people go through trauma and it can create huge barriers, but at the same time you need to get through it. I use it as a reason to keep going and do better. Look at me now. I now have my own place, a stable relationship and I’m trying to get a job and learn to drive. I couldn’t have done it without the staff at Centrepoint.”
We are so impressed by Layla's resilience and drive and wish her all the best for the future.

010 - Ben's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/bens-story-lasting-relationship

Helpline0808 800 0661
Ben became homeless at 15 and for the remainder of his teenage years, he moved between hostels, B&Bs, shelters and rough sleeping. At 19, Ben was placed into a Centrepoint hostel and from there a Centrepoint self-contained flat where he met staff members that were to have a lasting impact on his life.
Now 47, Ben is a father and teacher. It’s been a difficult road, and he doesn’t think he would have made it if it wasn’t for those staff members. Lana Moore, who was his key worker all those years ago still works at Centrepoint managing a young parents' service. Ben is still in contact with her decades later; testament to the power of that relationship.
As a child, Ben struggled to find consistency between his parents.
“My mum was very strict and my dad was the opposite,” he reflects. “I used to stay with him every two weeks. Those very different schools of upbringing created confusion for me.”
At the time, Ben was also being bullied at school and the hurt manifested in anger at home. He stopped going to school which created friction with his mum.
“My mum was struggling as a single parent with two boys,” he reflects. “It wasn’t easy for her and I’m able to see that now, but back then I was just angry.”
Eventually, the situation became untenable and Ben went to live with his dad. At the same time, his schooling broke down.
Ben looks back now and realises that his dad really didn’t know how to parent. Initially, this meant freedom, but looking back, he now realises it was neglect.
“My dad never worked and spent most of his time in the pub. He never really provided for me. It wasn’t his fault, but he just didn’t understand what it meant to be a parent. He hadn’t had it modelled to him.”
It wasn’t long before social services intervened and at just 15, Ben was moved into a hostel for the homeless.
“I was too old to go into a foster home, by then I was 15, 6’2” and 17 stone, Nobody was going to try and put me in care so I ended up being the youngest person in the hostel. I remember that time being really difficult. All my possessions were in a black bag, I had to fend for myself.”
Ben’s unresolved trauma played out in angry and aggressive behaviour. This meant he was continuously moved on for breaking the rules. In fact, he moved over 15 times over the following four years. It wasn’t the stability a teenager needs and just aggravated the situation further.
At 19, Ben was referred to a Centrepoint hostel where he had a key worker called Mercy who he remembers as being amazing and progressive. “She cared about what she was doing. There were dedicated staff there who understood how to work with traumatised young people. They got me out in good time and from there  I moved into a self-contained flat at a Centrepoint service in Camden."
It was here that Ben met staff members Theresa and Lana. These two individuals were to have a huge impact on his life.
But when Ben first arrived at the service, he was volatile and angry; he is the first to admit that he wasn’t an easy person to work with.
“I was like a volcano when I got there, he remembers. "I had so much rage in me and  I put them through so much, but they never gave up on me.”
Lana, who still works at Centrepoint, confirms this.
“He was so angry when he got to us and reading his case notes was quite frightening. I don’t think anyone had really given him the time before, but we gave him time and patience and the confidence to rise above it.”
Lana used difference techniques to find ways to support Ben to reduce his anger.
“Ben did not value himself, he would often put himself down and say he wasn’t intelligent because he had left school early without gaining qualifications. In his sessions, I would point out all his strengths and encourage him to do the same. Gradually, he started to build back his confidence.”
This approach clearly had a huge impact on Ben. Talking to me over two decades later he says,
“There was nothing that Lana did that didn’t stick with me. I put her through hell, but she was always there to remind me of my worth. She always told me ‘Ben you’re good. Ben, you’ve got potential. Ben you can do it.’ Theresa was a woman of action too. If I said I was struggling with something, she would just bring me into the office and sort it out there and then, letting me use the computer or the phone. They were like mothers to me. They understood me more than I understood myself. If they weren’t there to support me, I’m really not sure if I would have made it. I don’t think I’d be here with a career and a daughter without them.”
Ben is still in contact with Lana over two decades later.
“Sometimes I don’t speak to her for a few years and I have to dig out old phones to find her number]," he laughs. "It feels like a blessing to still be in contact with her. She’s wicked."
Ben has come a long way since moving out of Centrepoint. He is settled in his own home, has a child and teaches Electrical Engineering at a college.
“I love my job. It’s wonderful being able to have a positive influence on young people’s lives. For me, that’s massive. I really love to see people doing well, especially if they’ve had struggles. I’m one of the lucky ones. Some people don’t make it if they’ve been through what I went through and I really love being able to give back. I can help them do what I wish I could have done earlier in life. For me, that’s living the dream.”
His advice to other young people is quite personal to his own story.
“Stick with your education. I thought there was no going back for me when I stopped going to school at 13. I thought I had no future and that nobody cared. But you should never give up. Keep the fire burning inside yourself. Even when it’s just a smouldering ember, just find something to keep it burning.
Ben talking with other Centrepoint Alumni as part of a panel at Sleep Out 2023
Ben recently spoke about his experiences at Centrepoint's fundraising event Sleep Out. He talked about the impact that staff members like Lana had on his life, saying "I really don't know if I'd be here if it wasn't for people like her. I'd most likely be in prison or worse."  Lana was in the audience and says she was moved to tears by his words. "It meant a lot to hear him talk," she says. "It reminds me of why the work I do is so important."
Ben made it through despite his difficult start and although he was helped by those dedicated staff members, it was also down to his incredible resilience. Hats off to you Ben!

011 - Ziggy's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/ziggys-story-using-my-experience-good

Helpline0808 800 0661
I come from Poland where I had a fairly normal life growing up. I was raised by my grandparents. They were not rich but shared with me the most important feeling which is love for another human being. I played football and spent time with friends like a normal teenager.
When I was 16, my grandma was diagnosed with leukaemia.
Knowing that my grandma, the one who raised me from the day I was born, could die at any moment broke my heart, but I knew that I could not show my despair in front of her. I used to travel to the hospital every day after school or football practice just to spend more time with her as I knew that each day could be her last.
My grandma was in and out of hospital and was doing well, but and then life hit us again. My grandpa was diagnosed with brain cancer when I was 17. I left school and stopped football practice to care for my grandma. I fed her, washed her, cooked for her and chatted with her whilst my grandpa was in hospital for a year until he died.
Unfortunately, knowing that my grandpa passed away made my grandma weak. She died three weeks later. I had to prepare everything for their funeral. My mental health was very poor; I was anxious of going out and scared of what was going to happen to me. I turned to alcohol as my coping mechanism, ignoring my bills and everything around me. I had some money left as my grandpa had life insurance, so I used it to move to the UK and there I spent it all.
When I arrived in the UK, I rented a room and was lucky enough to find a job in a warehouse where I made new friends. We rented a house together and I felt happy because finally I had some people around me again.  We worked together and drank together after work or on our days off. One of them introduced me to cannabis. It made me feel better and blocked some of the pain I was feeling. When cannabis was not enough, we decided to take cocaine and pills and I ended up being addicted to tramadol, alcohol and cannabis. My addictions caused me to lose my job and I could not pay my share of rent. My “so-called” friends told me to leave their house. None of them were interested in helping me. They were there when I was intoxicated and had the money but left me when I had nothing.
On the day I was due to leave, I got drunk. I wanted to hurt one of them and didn’t think about the consequences. The police were informed, and I was arrested at the house with a knife in my pocket.
I was placed in bail accommodation for the period of my trial. I received a suspended sentence and community service.
Unfortunately, I couldn’t stay at the bail hostel and because I didn’t have a home or any income, I becamehomelesswhich was further compounded by the fact I knew very little English. I did not know where to seek help; I did not know where to go or what to do with myself. I slept in the bus station or empty buildings for about two weeks before I was found by an outreach team who sent me to Bradford Nightstop and after two nights I was given a room in a Centrepoint hostel.
That was the time when my life changed. I received a lot of support from staff members. They enrolled me incollege, taught me English and supported me with my mental health.  I was at the hostel for around five months before I moved into a lower support service with Centrepoint.
My support worker asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I did not have much ambition so just responded, “I don’t know, any warehouse job”. They encouraged me to raise my sights as they could see a lot of potential. They supported me for three years until I was independent enough to move on. I started kickboxing training; I went to college where I undertook NVQ Level 2 in Health and Social Care and my key worker found a placement for me as a trainee substance misuse worker. After a year, I was offered a part-time job there and not long after that, I got another part time job as a health trainer for the NHS where I managed a caseload of clients with health barriers such as: anxiety, depression, lack of motivation, bereavement, lack of confidence, financial difficulties, diet and fitness.
I converted to Islam in 2013 after researching different faiths. The Islamic faith has been keeping me on a straight path for years.  I truly believe that God is testing us throughout our lives. For me, it means God loves us more when sending a tough test upon us.
Today, I am 29 years old, doing my NVQ Level 3 in Health and Social Care and working as a support worker in supported accommodation for homeless young adults or those at risk of homelessness.
I try to use my personal experience to help others in similar situations. Things are so different for me now. I used to have no home and now I have a four-bedroom house (with a mortgage of course). I have been happily married for  two and a half years and we are awaiting the birth of our first child in March. I am so grateful for all the support I received from Centrepoint.
The last thing I would like to share with everyone is what I learnt years ago while being supported by Centrepoint. You can do whatever you want with your life: make “real” friends; work hard and stand up when life knocks you down because you can do it!

012 - Ben's Story
SOURCE: https://centrepoint.org.uk/ending-youth-homelessness/real-stories/bens-story-musics-always-been-thing-ive-gone

Helpline0808 800 0661
Ben, 21, became homeless when he was struggling with his mental health and was referred to Centrepoint for support. He's now at college studying music production and has been sharing his love of music in the local community and beyond. He dreams of going to university and seeing where his music will take him.
Ben came to Centrepoint during a period where he was struggling with his mental health and getting the right support he needed. His anxiety meant that he found it hard to leave the house and due to his unpredictable mood swings he was asked to leave the family home.
When Ben found himself homeless at 16, he moved into supported accommodation in Greater Manchester. The accommodation wasn’t suitable for someone his age and in his situation. “When I moved into the support accommodation, I was 16 and I was very vulnerable. There were 25-year-olds asking me for money and to buy drugs. At that age you’re very vulnerable to people who are older. You look up to them and think they’re right”, Ben remembers.
Whilst living here, Ben’s mental health was getting a lot worse, and he was turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism. There wasn’t any real support available to him and he was finding it hard to manage his feelings of anger, which frequently bubbled over into arguments and outbursts with other residents and staff. After a discussion with his GP and family, they decided the best option for him was to go to hospital and get the mental health support he needed.
Whilst in hospital he was able to get some support from the doctors and find medications and coping strategies that worked better for him. However, after only 6 months he was discharged and asked to leave the hospital. He didn’t feel well enough or ready to go and the thought of going back into supported accommodation was overwhelming. His care co-ordinator mentioned that Centrepoint would be able to help him, but Ben wasn’t sure given his last experience of shared accommodation.
He knew that going back home wouldn’t be good for him and accepted the offer to move to a Centrepoint house. He didn’t know what to expect and was really surprised at what the space and staff were like. He remembers how welcoming they were when he arrived and the positive impact that had on him. He said “they actually see how it is from your perspective rather than their own. They treat you how we should be treated”.
However, whilst living here, Ben began drinking one night and got into an altercation with one of the night staff. This put his place at the house in jeopardy, and after a consultation with all his support team, it was decided that Ben would be moved to another accommodation. This decision was agreed with everyone involved and whilst a new place became available, he temporarily moved back in with his mum. For Ben this was a pivotal moment and guided his future actions and behaviours whilst living with Centrepoint. “That’s the last time I’ve misbehaved or disrespected anybody. I think that was a real eye opener and Centrepoint kept their word and set me up when it was ready”.
Whilst living in his new accommodation, Ben developed a close relationship with his key worker, Jay, who helped him, alongside his stepdad, look at options for a college placement. Ben had tried to attend college a few years before, but after struggling with his mental health, he wasn’t able to continue with his studies.
After originally looking at bricklaying courses, Jay was struck by how passionate Ben was about music and together they completed his application to a nearby college for a music production course. Ben said, “I wouldn’t have applied for myself. I would not have gone there by myself. Honestly, even if I knew I wanted to, I wouldn’t have done it. I thought it would have been too much, but now I’m going there”.
Together, they went to the induction and Jay helped Ben to get all the relevant documentation to enrol and set up with student finance. He even drove him back and forth from the college to make sure that he felt comfortable with where he was going and support Ben with taking this step. Ben commented, “I think Jay would do that for anybody in Centrepoint. Whether it’s music or a different subject or whether it’s a job, he’s really supportive with everything – Centrepoint are definitely really lucky to have Jay”.
From a young age, Ben was always drawn to music and can remember teaching himself to play the piano in his mum’s room growing up. Music has been a key part of his life and something that has followed him throughout his journey, giving him a source of release when he’s needed it.
“Music’s always been the thing I’ve gone to. If something’s bothering me, I put all that tension and stress into my music. I think it’s a really good way to express myself and it’s not harming me and not harming anyone else. I think it’s one of the best things to be able to do and go to when you’re feeling like that.”
Alongside his music production course, Ben has had some great opportunities to showcase his incredible talents. From playing to intimate audiences at local senior living centres in partnership with the housing association to recently performing at his town’s Christmas light switch on to over 200 people, Ben is always excited at the chance to play his music. Reflecting on these opportunities, Ben is grateful for Jay pushing him to show his musical talents to the world. “The person I've got thank is Jay because he's helped me to get my music out there just as much as I do”.
With just over a year left on his music production course, Ben is already thinking about what’s next. He has plans to get himself a space on a music course at university to continue studying his love of piano and production. He's currently living in a house with another young person and is enjoying the independence and possibilities the world has to offer.
When looking back at his own journey, a piece of advice he has for anyone who has a passion they want to pursue. “If you’re into something just carry on doing it. Don’t ever quit it because something’s happened. I’ve had so many reasons where I should have just stopped playing piano or given up, but I didn’t. I just kept going to it and it’s ended up being something I never thought I would be doing”.
We’re so excited to see what comes next for Ben and can’t wait to hear his music and see his name in lights one day!
With your help, more young people like Ben can get the support they need to reach their full potential.
