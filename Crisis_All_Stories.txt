When Piotr lost his job and was unable to pay his rent, his landlord pushed him out of his home. He was forced into homelessness and slept in a park.
“It was a very tough winter sleeping rough, it was so cold. I was mentally down and had suicidal thoughts. I always chose places where nobody could see me. I felt sad and hopeless.
“You must think about where to sleep, especially when it’s raining or cold. You need to find anything that will help you keep warm; you need to think about food and where you can go to get clean. It’s not someone’s choice, they don’t choose to be on the street. People must understand that.”
His life changed when A&E at an hospital called Crisis. Over two years, Crisis supported Piotr into different accommodation including Brent’s night shelter, hotels, and Crisis at Christmas hotel.
“Olivia, my Lead Worker, is my second mother. She makes me feel good, because I have somebody who I can trust, and talk to about my problems. She helped me get access to immigration support, training, alcohol support and found me somewhere to live and a job. She referred me to the Employment Brokerage team, and I got a job on the London Underground as a cleaner.
“Olivia helped me to find a GP, and I told them about the problems my voice, and they sent me for the scan, and told me that I had cancer.
“I collapsed mentally again. I couldn’t work because I had to have so many radiotherapy and chemotherapy appointments.
“When I found out I had cancer, Crisis found me a room in the hotel and then I sofa surfed at a friend’s house. I had to go for radiotherapy every day, so it was not possible to work as well. Crisis helped pay for my daily trips to the hospital for radiotherapy.
“Now, I am cancer free and I’m in temporary accommodation, sorted by Crisis. I have a room, my own toilet with the shower, a small unit with a sink and fridge, and an oven with two hobs. On every floor, there is a laundry machine and dryer too. It’s much better and I have privacy.
“When something happens, Crisis will help me as much as they can. I am very happy. I’m a completely different person. It’s like starting a new life, thanks to Crisis.”

When Abdul lost his home at 47, he had no idea how quickly life could unravel. Following the breakdown of his marriage, he found himself moving between parks, hostels, and underpasses, with nowhere safe to go and no clear path forward.
Abdul, former Crisis Member
Then one day, a GP suggested he get in touch with Crisis—and that call changed everything.
Melissa, a Strengths and Assets Coach at Crisis, was one of the first people Abdul met. Her role, as she explains, is about more than just helping someone into housing. It’s about giving people the tools, confidence, and support to rebuild their lives for the long term.
Melissa, Abdul’s former Strengths and Assets coach
Together, Melissa worked closely with Abdul to break down those barriers. They started with the basics: how to use a smartphone, check emails, and read an energy meter. Gradually, they moved on to bigger steps—budgeting, setting up direct debits, and making sure Abdul had the right benefits in place to stay securely housed.
The role of a Strengths and Assets coach, is to support each member to see their own strengths, undoing years of self-doubt by proving they are more capable than they realise.
Abdul
But Melissa’s support didn’t stop at the practicalities. With a safe home secured, she encouraged Abdul to take steps to reconnect with the things that gave him joy and purpose. He joined art classes, started volunteering at the Crisis shop on Brick Lane, and accessed mental health support to begin healing from the trauma of homelessness.
Melissa
Today, Abdul is not just surviving—he’s thriving. And his story is just one example of how dedicated, one-to-one support can give a person experiencing homelessness the chance to move forward with dignity.
But the work isn’t done. Across Britain, homelessness is at an all-time high – rising for the third successive year. And while winter brings much-needed public attention and support, the crisis doesn’t stop when the weather warms.
At Crisis, we work 365 days a year thanks to the generosity of our supporters like you, helping each of our members to find a safe and stable home, access employment, and develop the skills they need to rebuild their lives for good.“Homelessness doesn’t take a summer break” Melissa says, and a gift in summer can be just as life-changing as one in winter.

Just as Henry's marriage broke down, his parents became very unwell. He had to go to Nigeria to look after them, and sadly, one of them died. But when he returned home to the UK, he had nowhere to live.
“When I came back, I was homeless. It was horrible. I stayed with someone my friend knew, but it was too much for him.
“One day, he said I needed to leave immediately. My heart was palpitating. In the morning I had to leave and was roaming about from one place to another trying to get support. I went to the council, and they said it was congested. They said people with children are priority, and they are right. I couldn’t cope anymore. There were no options for me, and I didn’t know what to do.
"A friend told me about Crisis. The lady that I first met really assisted me.
“Crisis got me a B&B for a week and was talking to the council to try and get them to help. After the B&B, I was moving from one place to the next and sleeping wherever there was an opportunity for me.
“It is not good for someone to experience homelessness. It is a very traumatic experience. Whether you’re on the streets or you are staying with someone temporarily, you don’t have your freedom at all."
Henry was housed three months after he contacted Crisis and has a room in shared accommodation.
“For me, having a home is like being on top of the world. When you have a room to yourself, and you can sleep and wake up when you want, it’s everything.
“My lead worker is a professional with great humanity. Even if I had lots of questions, she would listen to me and assist me to her best means.
“Crisis is quick to assist you. They listen to your case. They assess you; they will go to any length to make sure they solve your problem for you. I believe that Crisis has people of goodwill.
"I go to IT classes at the Skylight twice a week. I can use the computer a bit and email. I’m also in the Christmas choir, I love singing.
“My hope for the future is to contribute positively to society. I like working and I like doing charity work and volunteering. It’s a very good experience. I can never forget Crisis; they are an organisation that will live with me until I die.”

When Stephen returned to the UK after working abroad, he couldn’t find work which meant he couldn’t get a home.
Stephen stayed with his daughter, was forced to sleep on sofas at friends’ houses and in friends’ art studios on an inflatable bed. Here, he tells his story - and how Crisis have supported him twice out of homelessness.
Meeting Crisis for the first time
“10 years ago, I was forced into homelessness. My teaching contract wasn’t renewed, and I couldn’t make ends meet. I struggled with my mental health and couldn’t get work.
“I was homeless and slept in phone boxes and on the streets in Islington. When I was admitted to hospital, the clinical psychologist put me in touch with Crisis and that’s when I first met the charity.
“Crisis helped me into a home, gave me my own art studio at a Crisis project and helped me get a job in Oman teaching A-level Art."
Returning from abroad
“I was in Oman for eight years and returned with savings. When I got back, I found it difficult to get rented accommodation.
“It was so hard to find a home to rent without having a job. One person said they would take me on, but they wanted a £10,000 deposit because I wasn't working. I applied for so many jobs. I rented a little store in Islington and tried to sell my artwork, but over two years, I didn’t have enough money to cover the essentials.
“I couldn’t believe it was happening again. And at the same time the anxiety and depression that I had experienced a long time ago, started to slowly come back.
“At this time, I was staying with my daughter and moving around between family members. I wanted to support my family as much as I could when I was sofa surfing but within a year, I had half the money I saved. It got to the stage where it was becoming more difficult to stay with my daughter and she asked me to leave.
“I went to Islington council who struggled to find anything suitable for me because there wasn’t much around, so I slept on sofas at friends’ houses and in friends’ art studios on an inflatable bed. It was about six weeks after I’d been to the council that I went back to Crisis, and my lead worker, Jeremy, helped with doctor’s appointments, got me benefits advice, and pushed the council."
Getting support from Crisis
“Jeremy applied to food places in the area and found a pantry in Islington, where they do fresh vegetables and other stuff. For a little while, I got back into the art classes at the Skylight and funnily enough, they still have the same table from ten years ago that they used to have in the old art room at Crisis Bermondsey project.
“Thanks to Jeremy and Crisis, I’m now in an amazing flat that is my home. I appreciate everything that Crisis has done for me.
“I'm a two-minute walk from the river Avon. I’m going to do a lot of painting and will try and get some local places to sell my art. I can also now apply for other things and maybe even get a little part time job.
"Now I feel safe, I’ve got a home and I’m able to focus on having some sort of future. And that's important for anyone because it's your dignity.
“Rents are going up, bills are high and there are lots of other pressures. It’s important that people know about these situations and that there are a lot of people in this situation right now.”

Marianne has donated to the Crisis at Christmas campaign for the last few years and this year she has asked her grown-up children to do the same, instead of buying gifts for her.  Here she tells us a little more about her life and how she recently decided to support Crisis in another way.
“My career has been spent working in administrative roles in many different sectors; an IT company, a Further Education College and latterly the Police.  I am now retired and volunteer in the garden at a local hospital, helping restore what was once a beautiful green space.
“I live in the Welsh countryside surrounded by nature, and this has been reflected in a number of animal and bird charities that I support.  The Crisis Christmas appeal came through the letterbox some years ago and I decided it was time to support a charity that helps people.  We don’t see much visible evidence of homelessness where I live, but I know that it’s a serious issue nationally.
“I really admire those who work on the front line. Living in a remote village, I’m not able to help physically, but I’m doing what I can from a distance.  During the pandemic, I know that homeless people were given emergency accommodation, but it seems like the situation is worse again now.  And the recent floods have caused more people to lose their homes – there are so many factors contributing to homelessness.
“My children are both in their 40s now, and I have two grandsons. Recently, I realised that it had been many years ago since I made my Will.  Now that my circumstances have changed, it seemed like a good time to get it updated.  My solicitor pointed out that leaving donations to charity can reduce any potential liability to inheritance tax.
“I’ve included a gift to Crisis in my updated Will, so that they can help someone facing homelessness in the future.”

"My name is Kaz and I was Eva’s lead worker. That’s the two of us in the photograph , which was taken just a few months ago. As you can probably tell from the picture, I adore Eva. The strength of our relationship is only possible thanks to your generous donations.”
Ending homelessness is about so much more than putting a roof over someone’s head, it’s about providing the tailored support a person needs to rebuild their life, in many different ways.
Eva worked in a hotel until the pandemic hit in 2020 and she lost her job. When her marriage broke down, she was forced into homelessness. Having migrated from Greece to the UK almost three decades ago, she had no family to turn to, and without an income, she was forced to sofa-surf. For four months, she had no room of her own, no privacy and no stability. When she had to move on, the council didn’t see her as a priority, despite her age, and turned her away because they said her paperwork needed updating.
Eva had no option but to sleep on the streets. She told Kaz about her experience:
Thankfully, Eva heard about Crisis through a friend, and asked for help at one of our shops. It was then that she was introduced to Kaz.
First, she found Eva a place in a shelter in an area she knew. They then started to look for a flat Eva  could afford on Universal Credit, through one ofthe private landlords we work with. Eva took the first flat she saw, and Kaz was able to help with the paperwork. Thanks to the donations from our supporters, she was able to pay for the deposit and one month’s rent, as well as a mattress and bedding – something Eva couldn’t have done alone.
From there, the next step was helping Eva access the disability payments she was entitled to, as well as organising her personal documents, which she hadn’t updated since first moving to the UK, along with a visit to the optometrist for glasses.
Soon Eva was settling into the local community, going to the church and making new friends. After Eva was forced into homelessness following the breakdown of her marriage, it was vital to support her to form a new support network in order to improve her confidence.
Through arts and wellbeing sessions run at our Crisis Skylights – including jewellery marking, yoga and computer literacy – Eva quickly developed skills and hobbies that brought her joy and built her self-esteem.
We continue to face increasing demand for our support, but your gift will help our team to support more people to secure a home and rebuild their lives after homelessness. Today, two years on from when she first met Kaz, Eva has now moved into sheltered housing for over 60s.
Thanks to you, Eva now feels safe.

Support Crisis at Christmas today
Donating to ourCrisis at Christmas appealcan help someone like Charlotte start to build their life beyond homelessness. Here's her story...
Charlotte moved to the UK from Trinidad and Tobago over 20 years ago, and was living in temporary accommodation when Crisis first supported her. Jessica, her Crisis coach, helped her to find a new home and apply for funding to start a business. She now owns a successful food business in Edinburgh serving Caribbean vegan cuisine.
“My mum had cancer. We were all living in the same house with her, just to support her. After she passed, they said we had to leave the house as they’re going to sell it. It was privately rented. I was staying with my older sister, but my life had stalled. I didn’t realise how much I was still grieving. And then, when I had to leave, I went into temporary accommodation.
“My daughter was moving with me from place to place. Then they told me that I’d missed a message to say I’d got a council place. My phone was broken at the time, but they didn’t know, so they were still sending me messages.”
Charlotte was introduced to Crisis. “First time entering Crisis, I’ve felt at ease. They were very friendly. I think the one thing I remember feeling is not feeling like I’m being ‘put down’.
“My first day at Crisis was helpful. I’m trying to find the right words because “helpful” is not enough as it was so much more than help. There was no judging. It was just a feeling of, “You’re a human being going through a situation and we’re here to help you,” and that was it. They didn’t care what the situation – it didn’t feel like they cared what the situation was or whatever, it was just, you’re in a moment and you’re having a moment. This is not you. At least I felt that they understood that this wasn’t me, and I just needed some help to come out of this situation that I was forced into.
“They helped me with paperwork and helped me to get out of that situation. They provided a deposit for my new home, and it just took a weight off my shoulders.
Charlotte told her Crisis coach, Jessica, that she wanted to start a business. Jessica supported her to apply for a Changing Lives grant. “I had to build a business plan, have an idea of where I wanted to go, what I’d be spending and stuff like that. I was given £1,500. That money has allowed me to set everything up."
Jessica has been by Charlotte’s side as she’s developed her business. “She’s helped me to plan where to go next. She supported me without making decisions for me.
“I do smoothies and street food, but it’s all really healthy. I make marinade sauces too, like the pepper sauce I’m just bringing out. Everything is homemade.Everything’s vegan, everything’s fresh. We do food for festivals. We do food for birthdays, and we do all different occasions. Caribbean food is often seen as jerk chicken and a curry, so it’s like if you don’t have that on the menu, then you’re not true Caribbean. I want to show that vegan food can be just as tasty.
“For the future, I am hoping to get my sauces in grocery stores like Asda and Tesco. Having my own business means security. It’s given me the opportunity to try something.
"Because of the grant and the programme, I opened up my eyes to see that there’s so many different levels or avenues that this business can go into. So instead of being closed off, I’m now wide open to accepting things. It’s taught me to come out of my shell and have a bit more faith in myself."
Now Charlotte is housed in the privately rented sector. “My home is finally home. When I get in, I literally close the door, I take a deep breath, and it’s just home. I haven’t had that feeling in a long time. I’m trying not to let the business overtake the house – but at least now I have the space to cook!”
Charlotte returned to Crisis for Christmas 2023 to prepare food for our Christmas guests.
"The atmosphere during Christmas was amazing. I didn’t expect to be so full on in a good way. For this Christmas, I’m going to try and visit Crisis again."

Support Crisis at Christmas today
Donating to ourCrisis at Christmas appealcan help someone like Gaz start to build their life beyond homelessness. Here's his story...
“I’ve always been a positive person and helped other people. Always had a caring nature but I had a tough childhood. But that’s given me the skills and the attributes to be of use now. My mum was deaf from birth, and she had schizophrenia. I left with my dad when I was four. And my dad was an alcoholic, we were in bedsits, so I had experience of not having housing even back then.
“I got arrested in 2013 but just previously, I was on holiday in Thailand. After three days, I had a cardiac arrest, my lungs stopped which made my heart stop. But this is because I didn’t love myself; I had no therapy for my trauma since childhood.
“When I got arrested three months later, I wanted to work hard to better myself. I created a structure, and I was away from that harmful lifestyle. But then I had abandonment issues which I didn’t know at the time; I realised when I had therapy. When I was 38, I had a broken heart from a failed relationship, and I was still on probation. But when the first lockdown happened, I moved into a house share where my half-brother was in the room next door. He is lovely but I just started giving up. I was having a mental breakdown.
“I felt so much pressure and my life just spiralled out of control.”
“One day, I decided to leave that life. I visited the soup kitchen because I didn’t have any money and became homeless. As soon as you run out of money, that’s it; that’s how much your life can change in one day. I remember walking down the road, a hot day, and seeing these happy people walking past and all your thoughts start going back to your childhood, where did it go wrong. That’s when I went to the library and found a leaflet about Crisis.
"I thought I’d give it a go and I didn’t know what I was going to be walking into. It was just amazing. It was life-changing, and from the minute I walked in and sat down, met the receptionist and then sat down for a bit, I could just sense that this was just a different vibe. It was unlike any other organisation or anything I’ve been to in my whole life. There was just a real warm, caring vibe and it was just amazing, yes, and changed my life.
"Then I met my lead worker, and she was absolutely amazing. It was all about what she could do to help me progress, what she could do to help my situation, is there anything that I need. And then she told me about all the classes and stuff that they do here, and I just got involved in everything and just fell in love with the place.
“Crisis helped me have a structure instead of going mad and being out on the street. I don’t know what I would have done without them. Crisis gave me all the resources, got a place in a hostel.
“It’s not rocket science. If you haven’t got a roof over your head, it’s going to be difficult to progress in life.
“Crisis also helped me get my medication. There’s a doctor drop-in on Tuesdays. I’ve been with Crisis nearly 18 months now and I’ve seen people get their lives transformed.
“There’s just no negativity at Crisis. I’m even starting to look towards pursuing some of my dreams because of the foundation that these people have given me. And I’ve done some things for Crisis which I didn’t think I’d be able to do, like talk to 200 people online for Lloyds, or reading at the Carol service to 500 people.
“I also got the support from Kaitlyn, my lead worker, she’s always telling me how proud she is.
“My first night at my own flat, I had blow-up beds. Crisis got me blow-up beds because we were waiting for my furniture pack to come, which Crisis and Kaitlyn sorted out as well. I have nice neighbours and we have our own little Whatsapp group. We ask whose turn is it to do the bins.
“We shouldn’t live in a world where you can’t have a home; everyone should have a home."
For Crisis at Christmas in 2023, Gaz was a keen volunteer, and he wrote the foreword for the Christmas magazine. He also gave a speech at the Cathedral during the Christmas carol service.
“This is my second Crisis at Christmas. Last Crisis at Christmas, I did absolutely everything. I did art, where we made tote bags and t-shirts, and I’ve done the sing-alongs, I’ve done the quizzes, the bingo. Just absolutely everything. I volunteered on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.
“I’ve met some amazing people and getting involved with everything at Christmas with Crisis made my Christmas. You know, Christmas is hard for some people, and especially hard last year and will be again this year. But the stuff that you do with Crisis takes your mind off everything and you feel part of a nice, caring, warm community.
“I’ve been looking forward to Crisis at Christmas because I like Christmas anyway. It was rubbish when I was little. Now I’m older, I can make my own Christmas, and I just like the vibe. As soon as it was getting near Christmas, I was onto Rachel and saying, “I want to volunteer,” and, “when’s the timetable coming out?”
“My favourite part of Crisis so far this year is just sharing the experience with the other members and seeing them throughout the year. Seeing their journey and seeing what we’re all getting out of it, due to Crisis and what they deliver and their ethos and what they bring at Christmas. It’s just been nice seeing people that have been through a real hard time with a smile on their face.
“The supporters and the donors, their money is going to good use. It’s changing people’s lives."

Donating to ourCrisis at Christmas appealcan help someone like Con start to build their life beyond homelessness. Here's his story...
Con came to Crisis as a guest during Crisis at Christmas in December 2015 and stayed in one of Crisis’ hotels. Nine years later, Con has been a homeowner for over a year-and-a-half. He has also been a manager of a service, housing homeless people and prison leavers. In 2023, using his personal experience, knowledge, and skills, he volunteered for four shifts at a hotel in Aldgate in London as a general advice volunteer.
“After university I got a job in marketing, and after that I worked as a buyer at a furniture company. I then worked in the automotive industry for 18 years, in project management. I had a very good salary – but, by then, I struggled with substance abuse.  In 2006, my relationship with my long-term partner broke down and I lost my job."
In 2013, he started staying at his friend’s house, until his friend forced him to leave. In 2015, he was forced into homelessness.
“I was sleeping rough on the streets in London. I had to move around betweendifferent neighbourhoods. The most frightening thing was that I started to get used to being homeless. When I started rough sleeping, I registered as homeless with my council, but I couldn’t prove that I’d been in the borough long enough to get any support. I didn't have a rental agreement to show them, to prove my connection to the area, as I’d been renting from a friend. I got legal aid and challenged the council’s decision, but after two years it ended with no resolution.”
"The first time I volunteered at a Crisis at Christmas centre in 2015, I was actually still rough sleeping. The other volunteers didn’t know my situation, I was really good at hiding it.
“That first Christmas in 2015, can you imagine what my life was like? Sleeping rough on the streets in December, in the freezing cold, and then going to the day centre where I was a guest and having a warm shower and something to eat. And then going to my late shift at Crisis at Christmas, and then leaving there and going back to sleep on the street.
“That Crisis at Christmas in 2015 was pivotal in turning my life around. I felt safe doing those shifts. With the other volunteers, I felt like this was my family. I’d never seen a group of people give so much of themselves.
"In 2022, I was an advisor to the manager at Camden day centre. And they changed the model of it for 2023, so I just ended up as a general advice volunteer, and I was at Aldgate Hotel."
In January 2016, Con visited the London Crisis Skylight centre and when he first walked in, a lead worker called Dan took him in. He was then assigned a progression coach, Sarah, who supported him to get a place in an emergency winter shelter. He received support in overcoming his substance use.
"I then became a Crisis member for two years. I managed to get housed in some supported accommodation provided. But when I left there, I was still able to accesssupport through Crisis, and they paid my deposit. I had to move into a private-rented studio.
“My Crisis housing coach helped me find a room to rent privately. She helped me feel confident about the process. I was scared about how to manage benefits and rent, and I’d been burying my head in the sand until then. My job coach helped me with CV workshops and motivation workshops. I started to come out of myself, and to get job interviews. I slowly became more independent, and I needed to check in with my coach less and less.
“I worked with Crisis for about two years, I was attending their courses. And I started volunteering at a refugee centre in 2016 May, and then I started volunteering at St Giles Trust. And I did an NVQ Level Three in Advice and Guidance, and I did an NVQ Level Three – One, Two and Three – in Interpreting, because I’m a linguist.
“People can support Crisis in a number of ways, they can donate time; they can donate clothing; they can donate financially.
"When you think when I came as a guest of Crisis in December 2015, and I’ve now been a home-owner for over a year-and-a-half, or about a year-and-a-half – and you know, I was a manager of a service, housing homeless people and prison leavers; quite a journey, isn’t it?”

After Zahra's marriage broke down, she was placed into a hotel with her children as part of her local authority's homelessness procedure. The hotel was infested with bedbugs and cockroaches which prompted Zahra to contact Crisis. With the help of her leadworker, Sophie, Zahra and her family were able to make a new start and leave homelessness behind for good. Zahra shares her story.
"I was told going into the hotel is what happens when you go through the homeless procedure. It wasn't going into the hotel that was the issue for me, it was the conditions there. On the first day, we noticed a cockroach and they moved us. Then a couple of days later we noticed another one.
"I started to realise it's not just one room, it’s the whole hotel.
"One of the rooms we went into had bedbugs. I literally ended up getting completely attacked. I had an allergic reaction and my whole body broke out in massive red blotches.
"My daughter got bit on her face and that really upset me because she had to go to school. She had other bites on her and I just felt terrible.
"They started to affect me how I never thought a bug would. I started to itch. My eyes started playing tricks on me. It made me feel dirty. And it really affected my daughter too. It's not very nice to live in that environment.
"We didn't get the support we needed from the council or the hotel manager. After six months or so at the hotel, this is what pushed me to contact Crisis.
“I contacted Crisis because I was feeling a little bit lost and extremely frustrated at constant reoccurring situations within where I was. I felt like, due to the fact I didn’t really know Birmingham that well, it would be good to have someone who maybe was more accustomed to the council or even the whole homeless process or families, as well as my situation. Having a marital breakdown was already quite difficult.
“I felt like I needed support in a few different areas. My first interaction with Crisis was a little nerve-racking. It’s always difficult explaining your situation to people.
"Sophie was assigned as my lead worker and she was lovely. I was nervous when we had our first meeting but she was really relaxed. She encouraged me to relax. We just talked through some of the issues I was having.
"She sent quite a few emails to the temporary housing officer, and she basically worked like an advocate. And I felt it was almost like a support network.
“Sophie was also supporting me about contacting my MP, which I did.
“I’ve just moved into rented accommodation so my main focus right now is just getting myself a little bit organised. It is a very nice home. I've been unpacking, and organising the children’s room. I’m also doing a lot of cleaning!
“The support that Crisis offers is very good. I love the fact that it’s holistic so it’s not just saying, “We’re going to help you with your housing,” they also support you with education, wellbeing and your health.
"I would like people to know that it will get better.”

Meet Gail, Crisis supporter and former volunteer.
My name is Gail, I was born and raised in Guyana and moved to the USA for graduate school. Then in 2011, I moved to the UK with my husband. I now work in immigration compliance. I experiencedhousing insecuritywhen I was younger and can empathise with anyone facing a similar situation.
Homelessness has always been an issue I’ve cared about.
Growing up in Guyana, I experienced a period of housing and food insecurity. And I’ve seen first-hand the challenges people face when they can’t rely on a roof over their head. Those memories have always stayed with me.
When I first moved to the UK, I hadn’t expected housing insecurity and homelessness to be such a big problem. In a country like Britain, with all the support systems available, I was surprised at the extent of the issue. It certainly wasn’t the impression I’d got from the television. And of course, the weather we have here in the UK. The cold and wet makes being without a home so much more challenging for people.
Charitable causes are important to me and my husband. We value empathy and kindness for others and believe you don’t have to be wealthy to leave something to those who need it. For me, it’s important to help in whatever way I can.
Not long after we came to the UK, we heard about Crisis at Christmas through the Big Issue and decided we should volunteer. It was such an incredible experience. We met lots of wonderful people and continued volunteering for a number of years before my husband became ill, and it was no longer possible.
I like the way Crisis supports and empowers people so they can rebuild their lives. When I was no longer able to volunteer, I continued donating now and then. Leaving a gift in my Will was another way I knew I could make a difference.
Homelessness is a complex issue, but it comes down to the fairness of our society.
There are so many reasons someone could find themselves without a home – the pressures of high rent, low wages, relationship breakdown, mental health problems, addiction – and there isn’t a simple answer.
And now, with the cost of living crisis, even more people are under pressure. When renting privately is so precarious even for working people, we need more protection for people living in insecure accommodation. And more support to help people who have lost their homes to get back on their feet quickly. I know that Crisis are campaigning for the policies that will prevent homelessness – to me that’s the kind of long-term solution we desperately need.
I hope my gift to Crisis will help them continue supporting the people who need it most. I’ve seen how hard it can be to experience housing insecurity and I want to make a difference for someone who might one day find themselves in that situation.

In 2022, Fadekemi and her family were forced to move out from their house as the landlord wanted to refurbish it. When the council refused to accept her children’s birth certificates as proof of identity, the family was forced into homelessness. She tells their story.
“I was born in Nigeria. After my studies, I worked for various finance companies. I met my husband and we got married. He moved to the UK to study then I joined him later with my first child who is 20 now. When I got here, I had two more children, who are now aged 16 & 12.
“When we arrived, we got leave to remain but not indefinite leave to remain. This means that every two and a half years, me, my husband and my oldest child have to apply to extend our visa. We’ve done this for four times so far and after ten years, we’ll have indefinite leave to remain which means we are no longer subject to immigration control. The last check in we have to do is in January 2024.
“In 2022, our landlord told us to move out as he needed to refurbish the house. We informed the council about this as we couldn’t afford to move. We filled in the homeless form but then we got our possession letter to move out.
“Then, we received a message from the council saying they needed to see my youngest children’s British passports. They hadn’t asked for that once throughout the process. They had only asked for their birth certificates and our proof to live in this country. Now the council was saying they aren’t able to qualify us for housing without their passports.
“It was too late then. The process to apply for passports was going to take a long time and a lot of money. This wasn’t right as they were born here. It’s just me, my husband and my eldest that have to renew our visa, not them. We had to save money for our visas, so I wanted to make sure we had our indefinite leave to remain first. We knew then we were going to be homeless.
“We spent two months in a hotel. It was really bad. We had to move from one hotel to another. There was no means of cooking. We had to wash our clothes in the bath. It was terrible. The children were so down. We had to wake up so early in the morning because the hotel was one and a half hours away from their school. My daughter was so sad, she would always cry. It was a terrible time for us honestly.
“That’s when I went to Crisis. Caroline, my lead worker came in and she promised to help which she did.
“Crisis gave us money and supported with liaising with the council. Applying for passports was thankfully quick, and within a month, we received confirmation of the children’s nationalisation. With Crisis’s support, we took the letter to the council and then they started to look for a house. However, then they said there are a lot of people in the queue, so we have to look for a private house.
“We’ve now moved into a three-bedroom flat, though it’s overcrowded and my sons have to share one room, it’s not a hotel. We got it from the council but it’s still private, so rent is high.
“When we collected the key for our house, there wasn’t any furniture, but we were still happy to sleep on the floor. We were like, “Thank you, God.” Crisis supported us to get chairs, a dining table and a washing machine.
“Kudos to Crisis because they really helped. Without them, I don’t know what would have happened.
“My husband is still working, and I also got a job now. I work with young people who have autism. I help them to do their day-to-day activities, take them to their appointments and cook for them. I love what I do.
"I can cook jollof rice now. Our children love it.”

When John left prison, his probation officer referred him to Crisis in Merseyside where he was supported by Sharon. Now he’s moved into a flat and is volunteering as a gardener. We met to discuss his journey.
“I was involved in an altercation and was sentenced to ten months in prison. Probation put me in touch with Crisis. I met Sharon, and it’s really down to her that everything started moving forward in my life.
Sharon found me a flat and I moved in after staying at the hostel for six weeks. Crisis also helped me find carpets, furniture, blinds.
As well as finding me a home, they’ve helped make it more of a home.
I left prison feeling unsure. I didn’t know what to expect and without that support there and reassurance, I would have been feeling a lot more anxious. I wouldn’t have been given any drive or direction and I wouldn’t have been, as quickly, supported back into society.
I’m in a better place now than I’ve been in for a long time.
I had mental health problems as a teenager. Probably related to an unhappy home life. I was a million miles away from getting an education. Not being able to benefit from education and being forgotten about led me to drink and it’s led me to crime, which led me to prison which led me to homelessness.
My main focus is to see to my son again.
I have a son who is six now. Since he was born, I was always involved in his life, in raising him. I was given support in terms of implementing the processes to see my son again. They directed me to solicitors to give me free legal advice but it’s all going to have to go through the Family Court."

“I grew up with my two sisters, my mum and dad and my brother. I was very lucky to receive an amazing education and always wanted to be a footballer. But everything changed when my family’s home got repossessed. I was 18 and not classed as a dependant, so I was forced into homelessness.
“It was a real shock, but as a teenager I didn’t really think of myself as homeless. I just needed a sofa to sleep on. I worked in retail and as a chef for many years. In 2012 I went to university. When I graduated, I built a career in furniture retail and became a Showroom Manager.
“I saved a deposit and bought my first house which was amazing. I got married and in 2018, we had our son. Things were looking good, until lockdown when our relationship broke down and I lost my job.
“I was struggling financially and had so many plates in the air. My mental health really suffered, and I was hospitalised. The only thing that kept me going was the thought of my son. But then when I was released, I came home to an eviction notice. I was homeless again.
“That’s when a friend suggested Crisis. They were brilliant. They gave me housing advice and helped me access mental health support. I’ve got a flat now and I’m focusing on being the best dad I can be. That’s why Crisis is so important. They’re working on the root causes of homelessness so that the next generation don’t have to go through what I did.
“Crisis doesn’t overwhelm you. Their support enables you to make the changes you need for yourself.
“Slowly I’m working on myself and my life. I love football, and now play for FC Equalise which is all about increasing participation.”

“I came to Crisis because I was given notice on the property that I'm living in. I was referred to Crisis by somebody that I know. They suggested that Crisis might be able to help me. I hadn't heard of Crisis prior to that, but they were supporting my friend and able to help me because I've got poor mental health as well.“When my landlord served me with the eviction notice, I just felt sick. Myself and my 14-year-old daughter were really worried about what we would do. Fortunately, we benefitted from the COVID rules in that we were given six months rather than the usual two months before we got out. It still didn't really make it much better though. We still didn’t know what to do or how to find somewhere. We were worried because we knew there were loads of other people in the same position.“I was worried that I might get separated from my daughter, maybe I would have to send her to my parents’, and I would have to go somewhere else. Maybe we would have to go into a refuge again. So many things were going through my head, and I just didn’t know what to think.“When I came to Crisis, I was so impressed. They've really helped me so much. They helped me sort out a few problems with my bills in my current property and other practical things that I was having trouble with.“Crisis pointed me in the direction of social landlords and helped me with the housing application and supported me with the types of property that I could apply for because I have epilepsy. They suggested that I get a supportive letter from my epilepsy nurse about the sort of property that is suitable for me. They also stressed the urgency of me moving because of my mental health.“It has helped me so much with my mental health, coming into clay club and doing pottery and painting. I enjoy working with clay and painting. It takes my mind off other things that are going on. It is so relaxing.“It is good to know Crisis is at the end of the phone, if I need anything. If my friends hadn't recommended Crisis, I don't think I would have known where else to go for support. I'd previously fled a domestic violence relationship and hadn’t got this level of support from other charities.“I think housing options and other support agencies should be working together more closely. I just don't think housing options realise what homelessness is really like. They don't seem to work with you or tell you about the support that's available.“We are currently still living in the same property but they are hopefully going to do some repair work on it shortly.“My daughter and I are going to be moving into a two-bedroom house, which is close to my parents. Thanks to Crisis, we've managed to find a social housing property through one of the social landlords. We hopefully should be moving within the next few weeks and we can start a new life, out of the private rented sector and into social housing which is a bit more secure and better than where we are now.“I am looking forward to a new life where I feel more settled.“It's good to know Crisis is at the end of the phone, if I need anything.“I am proud of standing on my own two feet, leaving an unhealthy relationship and facing the world on my own with my daughter. It's been a complete change of lifestyle.“I would say please support Crisis. The work that they do is phenomenal. They support so many people in so many ways. If it wasn't for them, so many people would be so much worse off now. I’ve met so many other people in the last few weeks who have been supported by Crisis, with everything from cooking to painting, housing, and even helping them to do simple things like shopping that some people just take for granted."

Mohammad came to the UK after fleeing war at home. Like many people in his position, when his status changed to refugee, he received his eviction note from the Home Office accommodation and had two weeks to find a new place to live. When the council didn't help him in time, Mohammad was forced into homelessness.
“When I received the positive answer that my status had become a refugee, I received a written letter from the Home Office that I must leave the hotel within two weeks. Then I applied on the council system for accommodation as I was going to become homeless, and they generated an automatic serial number.
“Then they assigned me one caseworker. I sent an email to her that I will be homeless on 16 October. After two reminders, on 12 October, I went to the Council, and the security did not allow me to go inside and meet the staff because they told me that you can only contact them either by email or by phone number.”
When Mohammad didn’t receive the support needed in time, he was forced into homelessness on 16th October. That’s when he went to Crisis.
“Without money, I couldn’t rent a house and I had no friends or family in the UK who could help me. First night, after college, I had no option but to stay outside, in the cold with all my bags. I called StreetLink but they said they can’t get to me for another two to three days.
“I got help from my friend, so I was able to leave some of my bags in his room. After that first night, I had a conversation with my friend who told me to go to Crisis. When I first went to Crisis, I explained my situation and told them how my caseworker said I wasn’t a priority.
“Crisis helped me find a house within a month. Santy, my lead worker, introduced me to a landlord, and I did some viewings. I saw a room then and the landlord told me, “When the room is ready, come,” and then gave me the key on 15 November.
“Santy was amazing. He supported me so well. Crisis paid the deposit and a month's rent in advance.
“It’s really comfortable. Because if a person has a home, you can do everything. You can study, and think positively. If you do not have a home, you will think negatively of everything.
“A home is very important in life. If a person doesn’t have the protection, the shelter, and is forced to stay outside whilst suffering from mental health, it all gets worse and worse.
“I’m still doing my accountancy and English language courses. It’s two days in a week. Monday and Wednesday, Level II Accountants. One day on Fridays I do English Language Level II.
“I think I want to become a care worker.”

Originally from Lithuania, Algimantas has been supported by Crisis in Oxford since 2012 and a Crisis member since January 2023. At one point in his life, he was forced to sleep in a tent - even though he was working. When he lost his job, he moved into a local hostel temporarily before his Lead Worker, Will at Crisis found him a vacant room.
Algimantas has been living in his new home for just over a month, and loves it. His landlord is very happy with him. Algimantas is grateful for the financial support provided by Crisis which has enabled him to pay his first month’s rent. The support from Crisis has also enabled him to purchase furniture, which was essential as the room was virtually unfurnished when he moved in.Algimantas is also extremely grateful to Will for his advice help and practical support in finding suitable accommodation.“He is cool. He is a very nice person. Seriously, I respect this man. He is doing a good job and he has a lot of experience.”While, like many other people, he's finding it challenging to make ends meet in the current cost-of-living crisis, Algimantas is glad that he's no longer living on the streets or sofa-surfing. He recalls the moment he told himself that he could no longer continue living a life of such uncertainty and lack of security.“That’s it. Enough. I’m becoming too old. I’m still on the streets with no college or normal work.”Algimantas currently receives Universal Credit and housing benefit and his room costs £720.00 a month. He understands the need to live on a tight budget. Any increase in outgoings – however small – can be very difficult to manage. While he has experienced some issues in his new home including a faulty boiler which threated to increase his outgoings, Algimantas remains positive and optimistic about the future.“When you stay too long on the street, you see a lot of bad things, you spend your life on the street like a lot of my friends. This is just a shared room but when I get a normal job, I will get a house and bring my girlfriend to the UK.”On arrival, however, he sometimes found it challenging to communicate and, as a result, stressful. He struggled initially without a support system, until 2012 when he was supported by Crisis in Oxford.“You’re the first people who helped me with English.”He now offers friends experiencing homelessness support and advises them to seek help from others too. “I say to them, listen, come to my house. I feed you. You can stay two, three days. Then you go to Crisis, or you go to the council.”Algimantas is also planning to develop his literacy and numeracy skills further by starting evening classes in English and Maths soon as he doesn’t have any UK qualifications.“I want to go to the college, I want a part-time job, this is my mission. The more qualifications I have, the easier it is to find a good job.”As well as Crisis support, Algimantas is also receiving support from St Mungo’s around employment opportunities. He appreciates the advice, information and support that he has been given by others which is both helping him to improve the quality of his life and inspire others to do the same.“I respect you guys for trying to help people from the street. I really appreciate it.”

“I come from an Asian Indian Bangladeshi background. My mother left when I was really young so Iemigrated to the UK with my father and we had beautiful five years together.”
“At the age of 11, my father had a heart attack. That was very traumatic. There were a lot of problems between myself and my half-brothers. As soon as my father was gone the abuse started. It would be physical or mental abuse. It escalated very quickly.”
“If they had a bad day they'd come and take it out on me which is basically what led to me havingmy first drink. I was 12 at the time. That lasted until I was in my 30s.”
“At the age of 23 I got married and had two children. I had my son, and then a couple of years later I had my daughter. I would come back from a night out, and I would wake up in the morning, get a bit sober, and I would see them in bed, and that feeling was just overwhelming. I had a lot of unresolved trauma and this brought up a lot of repressed memories.”
“Eventually my wife and I got a divorce.”
“I couldn't work anymore. I was a mini-cab driver, with alcohol you can’t really work, you can’t drive. My whole world started crumbling. My car got sold off, I couldn’t pay the insurance. My mental health started escalating. I couldn't keep up with the bills, with the rent, everything is just basically falling apart around me.”
“After the divorce and losing the flat, I became homeless.”
Being referred to CrisisAfter going to an alcohol and drug treatment centre in West London, Foysol was referred to Crisis.
“That’s when I met Kat, one of the tutors at Crisis, who was offering the literacy course and Jeremy, who became my lead worker. Kat changed my life. She also referred me to Cherelle, my psychologist here at Crisis. We started our weekly sessions and we have been seeing each other for about two years now.”
Where he is nowFoysol completed a Welding and Engineering course and is currently part of the Changing Lives programme at Crisis to start his own business.
“I’ve always loved the way you can polish up metal and it just becomes shiny it just fascinated me. So I found the welding and engineering course that I wanted to do and did it. I graduated with 85 percent a year ago now. I was the second highest achieving student for that course for that year.”
“Now I’m with the Changing Lives programme at Crisis. I applied for a grant after I finished my course to start my business and the grant got approved. I want to get to a point where I can have my own online store.’’
He is now back living with his ex-wife and children.

Donating to ourCrisis at Christmas appealcan help someone like David start to build their life beyond homelessness. Here's his story...
“I have severe arthritis so I can’t work anymore. After my relationship broke down, I was staying with my daughter and her boyfriend. The pressure of living in an overcrowded home grew and the boyfriend kicked me out.
“I was completely lost. I thought, ‘What do I do now?’ I had nowhere to go and I was going to be walking round the streets with a big suitcase and a walking stick.
“I had no money for food. My other daughter booked me three nights in a hotel, because my parents said I couldn’t stay with them in Bournemouth.
“I phoned up the council and they got me a place in a hostel, and that’s where I first got in touch with Crisis. I made an appointment, and pretty soon after I met Kaitlyn, my lead worker. The first day I met her, she seemed to bring out this ability in me. She’s a very kind person who has helped me so much. Crisis has such beautiful, genuine people.
“I’ve always loved music and writing, but I’d stopped for years. Kaitlyn encouraged me to start writing poetry and lyrics again. One day we’d done some writing and she said it was absolutely brilliant. And I thought, ‘Someone likes what I’m writing’, so that gave me the confidence to write more – about life in general, the world, injustices; anything really.
“It was wonderful – just a little compliment, a little bit of kindness. I think giving people confidence and making them feel good is a part of building them up. She also helped me with housing and got me much higher on the list for places. So things were looking up.
“Around Christmas in the hostel, I put up a little tree, only about three foot, just stood on the table in my room. Kaitlyn, my lead worker told me about a wellbeing day at the Skylight Centre in Newcastle. The camaraderie was great. Everyone was lovely. I had a haircut, a massage – a mince pie! It’s what Christmas should be about really. Not too materialistic, just helping other people.
“Crisis gave me a tablet that day too, so I’m able to keep writing, which is lovely. I’d like to find a musician to put my poems and lyrics to music.
“I also had an eye test. My sight has deteriorated as I’ve got older, but I didn’t have a pair of glasses for four or five months. It’s important for reading letters, filling in forms and that sort of thing. I picked up my glasses from the Skylight five days later.
“I’d been bidding for places with Kaitlyn, but wasn’t getting anywhere. It’d been a time where I’d have a lot of horrible lows that really clout you over the head. But I’ve always kept a positive attitude – if things go wrong, at some point it’ll pick up.
“I saw one place and liked it because there was space for all my records. I bid for it and about three weeks later, it was mine. So many times, I’ve said to Kaitlyn ‘Thank you for getting me this’, and she keeps saying ‘No, you did it by yourself’. She’s such a kind person.
“Crisis seem to be going out of their way to help people long term, all year round. I’m so grateful.
“In the hostel, I didn’t have any freedom. I was given what they cooked, and it was often inedible. I had a Christmas dinner that made me ill for all of Boxing Day. Now I’ve got freedom to cook nicely. I can do my own thing here, listen to my records, you know? There’s no-one knocking on the door. I can shut the door and that’s it.”

Meet Stuart, Crisis volunteer and supporter
In 1999, Stuart had a comfortable life, with a lovely home, partner and children. But in the space of a few days that summer, everything changed. This is how he became part of Crisis:
“I lost everything and would have found myself on the streets if it hadn't been for the kindness of friends. I spent a few nights here, a few nights there, always leaving before I outstayed my welcome. I slept in my car on a couple of occasions because I was too embarrassed to ask if I could sleep at somebody’s house – again.
Compared to many of our Crisis guests, I was very lucky. After a few difficult weeks I had found somewhere stable to live and I was beginning to piece things together. But Christmas was looming, and I was dreading spending most of it on my own, only seeing my children briefly.
Then I remembered Crisis, and that’s how I became a volunteer on Christmas morning. The first job I ever did on shift was to help serve breakfast.
Since then, I’ve become passionate about doing anything I can to help Crisis. Leaving a gift in my Will is just one of those things.After the pandemic I realised it would be sensible to write a will.
I contacted George at Crisis, and he directed me to Farewill, which is a Will-writing service free for Crisis supporters. It couldn’t have been easier. And now I know my support for Crisis will help the next generation."
Stuart Cashmore, Crisis Volunteer
Farewill is the UK’s top-rated Will-writer
Using Farewill to write your Will is quick, easy and can be done from home. It’s free for our supporters and there’s no obligation to leave a gift to Crisis.
For more information about leaving a gift in your Will, contact George Shelley ongeorge.shelley@crisis.orgor 07814 654362.

Donating to ourCrisis at Christmas appealcan help someone like Michelle start to build their life beyond homelessness. Here's her story...
“This time last year, I had no home. I couldn’t afford my rent anymore and I didn’t have any support, so I was forced out.
“I could afford a B&B for a couple of nights, but then I ran out of options. So I’d go to this bus stop and the drivers would be really good to me – letting me onboard and always asking if I was okay. I just wanted to avoid the streets. The cold – it’s with you all the time. I started thinking, ‘Am I going to be out here on Christmas Day?’ I was so worried about that.
“I used to love reading in libraries – especially biographies. When I became homeless, my visits changed. I’d spend my days in libraries so I could stay warm. At least in the library I could charge my phone and try to talk to the council. But I had no privacy, so it was hard to make any progress. Everything just became so complicated.
“Having someone in your corner makes all the difference. So when I was referred to Crisis at Christmas, everything changed. I look back now, and that first day with them was my last day on the streets.
“It’s hard to ask for help. But after six months of sleeping rough, I knew I had to. Looking back, it was the most important step I took. The first time I walked into Crisis, the people were so welcoming. They actually looked me in the eye. It’s funny, but that’s the kind of thing you really miss. Because on the streets, you don’t talk to anyone.
“Straight away, I felt settled. There was no judgement, just understanding. I had a hot meal to keep me going. They put me up in a hotel, where I could sit and be safe. It’s like a weight had been lifted.
“I met my lead worker, Kate, and she was by my side from that day on. I felt like I could talk to her about anything and everything. And she did all she could to help me find a permanent home. I had so many things going on before – but now I could just focus on what I needed to. It was like you're being washed out to sea and the waves keep pushing you further out, but with Crisis you can paddle to shore.
“I spent Christmas Day with Crisis and other members. We had Christmas food, including my favourite - mince pies with custard. There was karaoke, bingo – I even got my nails done. I had an eye test too, so I really felt looked after. I felt like a human again.
“All the while, Kate was working with me to help me find a place. It was tough but I’m proud that I’ve got through it.
“In March, I moved into my new home. And I can’t wait to spend Christmas there this year. Even now I can’t stop checking I’ve got my keys – I haven’t had my own keys for so long! Crisis helped me furnish it, so I could really make it my own. I love my teal sofa. Feeling settled has helped me focus on what’s next. My aim now is to train up and become a bereavement counsellor.”

“In 2021, I moved back to London from Sudan to live with my parents. My husband had to stay in Saudi Arabia, but my dad was sick so I was supporting him. When my dad passed away, I stayed with my mum and tried to find a job, but it was tough because of the pandemic.
“I got pregnant, and that just made it harder to find a job. The council moved my mum into a shared house after my father passed. I knew I couldn’t stay there, so I went to the council to ask for help. My worst worry was that I’d have my baby and have nowhere to stay. But they rejected my application for homelessness assistance. I didn’t know what to do. I had no options. I still couldn’t find a job because no-one wanted to hire a pregnant person. I was really feeling down, I was depressed.
“I called Crisis, and I was so happy that they helped me straightaway. I was so used to getting bad news, bad news, bad news – but that was a good day. They understood. It was a big relief.
“Within a week, I had a lead worker, Hasina, and that’s where it all started. She really helped me out and guided me. It felt like there was someone who cared and wanted to help.
“The Crisis legal advice team got the council’s decision overturned. I moved into temporary accommodation, but I didn’t feel safe. A man in the house really scared me. I’d wait until he was gone before I left my room. I was worried about still being there when my baby was born.
“Again, Crisis helped me by challenging the suitability of my accommodation, and I was allowed to start looking for better places while I was still pregnant. They also helped me to write my CV – two of them actually. One for applying for accounting jobs when my son is older, and one for the jobs I can apply for in the meantime. The support Hasina gave me was amazing.
“Crisis also referred me to Rising Stars while I was pregnant. They train you for three months and find you a job after. I had a job in an office reception for a month before I had the baby.
“I actually went into labour when I was viewing the place I’m in now. So I had my baby one day, and signed the agreement the next.
“I’m so happy that I have a home now with my son. I have the time to do things I enjoy, like crochet and sewing. My mum can visit too. Last year, I made her Christmas dinner – pizza, lasagne, ice cream. We felt like a family again.
“It means I can feel safe and secure, and that’s the main thing in life. I used to feel so scared and unsafe, but now I feel stronger.”

Attila moved to the UK in 2014 and worked in several jobs in catering and translation. In 2015, he was diagnosed with Raynaud's disease, almost lost his finger and had complications from an operation. He was then diagnosed with diabetes.
He returned to work as a security guard, having gained several qualifications in this field but when the pandemic hit, he lost his job. He then had to leave the country to visit his dying parents and when he returned to the UK, his Universal Credit payments were stopped.
"I lost my mother to cancer. I lost my father to COVID. It was a confusing time."
He was unable to find work due to the pandemic which forced him into homelessness.
Crisis at Christmas
"When I came back to London, my Universal Credit payments were stopped. I tried to appeal but didn't get anywhere. It was the pandemic and it was difficult to find work. Not being able to pay rent forced me into homelessness. I slept on the bus, too ashamed to sleep on the street, I slept on the train."
"I was sleeping rough for about seven months. I was very stressed and agitated. I was at risk on the street because of my diabetes."
"Another person who was experiencing homelessness told me about Crisis. Christmas was coming."
"Before Christmas, I walked into Crisis. They sent me to the hotel in East London. They gave me shelter, food, haircut. They also told me to apply for Universal Credit again."
"I am so grateful to my coach, David. He has helped me with Universal Credit. He also provided me with a travel card so that I could get to appointments. He set up an appointment with a psychologist. He knew I was capable of doing things so he let me make my own decisions. I decided I wanted to get a heavy machinery license so that I can drive HGVs and David supported me to do the Construction Scheme Certification Scheme (CSCS)."
Where he is now
"After the hotel, Crisis found me a flat in Lewisham. I've signed a contract for 6 months and I'm still here. It took me a couple of months to get used to it. Crisis provided financial support to get some furniture for the house too."
"It feels good because it is my home."
"All I have to say is thank you and well done. I will never forget it."

When Aaron's relationship ended, he was left with no option but to sofa surf.
“Sofa surfing was really unsteady. I could have been chucked out at any time. I never knew what was going to happen. I was living out of a suitcase or a bag, I couldn’t put my stuff anywhere, I had to ask permission to do anything, and couldn’t decorate how I liked.
Finally, he got a place in a hostel, and a friend told him about Crisis.
“It was like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. If I needed clothes, food, phones, they’ve been able to help me. It’s been nice to have that support because, before that, I had nothing.”
Aaron has moved out of the hostel into a rented property now and he finished the courses he was doing with Crisis.
“Hannah did cooking with me. I had Renting Ready courses with Janet which prepare you for when you get your own place eventually. And then my coach Mike helped me through day-to-day problems."
“I can just imagine me finally being able to sit down and nobody can kick me out. I’m on my own, I’ve got my own space. I can go in the shower, come out and not have to worry. Just basic living things I should have had anyway, I’ll finally have, which would be amazing."
"University looks amazing, I would like to go away for that. I can't focus on anything just yet because of my mental health but as soon as I f figure out what I want to do, then I probably will go into university. I need to find that thing I'm really interested in first. Maybe it's music."
“I’d like to thank the staff in the hostel. And Crisis. They supported me for months. They’ve been so helpful – they’re the ones that got me where I am today.”

Andrea has been renting her property since 2019 but during that time has experienced terrible conditions and things falling into disrepair.
“The landlady's done not one repair since I've been in this property. I've got no cooker, I've got no fridge, I've got no freezer, I've got no washing machine, I’ve got no lighting as well in a few of the rooms. The boiler – no. The meter needs to be changed as well. We haven't got hot water either. So just everything needs to be done in this property to be fair.
“I'm not eating as healthily as I could be. I'm eating a lot of microwavable foods or a lot of takeout as well. It's costing money that I don't have, to be honest, but you've got to feed yourself.”
“I reported it all to my landlady. My landlady's actually come here because she had to do the gas inspection so she knew what was going on in the property and she left it.
“The only good thing that I've managed to do is get my child out of it. My daughter should be home with me, but she's not.”
Andrea’s landlord issued her with a Section 21 notice to leave the property in 2021 but the process was taking a long time and she was waiting for the landlady to apply for the bailiffs. Until this happened, the council would be unable to help Andrea find alternative accommodation.
“In 2021, we were given the first Section 21 and told that she wanted to sell up. So we accepted it, we didn't want to stay here. I guess I was happy about receiving a Section 21 notice because I was living worse off than an animal.”
“She obviously couldn't sell the property so then she tried to act on anti-social behaviour. We got into court and on the 6 April, and it was then said that I need to move out of the property.
“My landlady comes the next day demanding that I leave the property with her mum and her daughter, shouting at me to get out of the house. And I told them I'm not leaving, I'm not being left to the streets because of this. I had to report her to the police and the council as well for her behaviour.
“We were waiting for my landlady to apply for the bailiffs, which she wasn’t going to do because she was getting the money directly to her. And until she did that, the council would not move me out of the property.
“I just want stability, do you know what I mean? I don't want to be moving around every five minutes.
“We didn't know where we were going to end up. And we were being given the impossible, looking for private rented accommodation. It's not going to happen here.
“With the low housing stock here as well, it's going to get worse and more of us are going to be moved out of London, I think.
“Growing up in Putney was amazing. We've got a really strong community here. I've lived in the Borough 35 years of my life, so I don't know anything different.”
“It's too expensive to rent – that’s the be all and end all. It's not going to happen here so where are we going to go?
“It's leaving people at risk of being vulnerable and being homeless and being stuck in temporary accommodation. It's not working. So the councils need to build more council homes.
Andrea no longer has to leave her home as she now has a new landlord, who is working to deal with all the repairs needed. “It’s amazing news, but not everyone has a happy ending.”
“Everyone deserves a home - it's a human right. Nobody in this country should be sleeping on the streets."
“Keep fighting the good fight. We're all stronger if we work together on it."
Update: A new landlord has now taken over Andrea's property. Her arrears have been cleared and she no longer has to leave her home. The new landlord is going to carry out the necessary repairs.

George worked as a face-to-face fundraiser for many charities and has been fundraising for the last 15 years. He enjoys working for various charities and meeting new people. He’s passionate about ending homelessness.
“I’ve worked as a face-to-face fundraiser for various charities such as, Shelter, Centrepoint, Cancer Research UK, UNICEF, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Red Cross, Breakthrough Breast Cancer, RSPCA and Friends of the Earth.”
He was forced into homelessness twice. The first time Crisis supported him, it was 17 years ago. Recently, he was forced to leave the house he was sharing with his ex-partner during Covid lockdown and had to sofa surf at his friend’s house. Crisis supported him to be housed and clear his debt.
“I was first helped by Crisis about 17 years ago. I was rough sleeping at the time. They got me into a hostel. From there I moved into a room in a house, and then about a year later, I started fundraising.”
“Recently, I was living in a place in East London, but didn’t have a tenancy agreement. I came out of work for a little while, couldn’t pay the rent, became homeless, got in touch with Crisis.”
“I was sofa-surfing at the time, at a friend’s, from last September, and then come January, I got a place now. So rapid work from Crisis and my lead worker, Seetal.”
“I live in supported housing and have a support worker who keeps in touch. It’s a two-year tenancy, and then every two years, they renew it as long as everybody’s happy with that.”
“Not having a tenancy agreement makes everything less secure. Like you have no legal protection. It has a massive impact on your own self-worth and your mental health.”
“There were times where I wanted to have my kids over but I was told I couldn’t have visitors. You want to say, ‘Well, hold on. I’m paying rent here’ but because of no tenancy agreement, you are limited on what you can do. It did affect my relationship with my kids. Thankfully, that’s getting back on track now. It’s just not having that legal protection.”
“It’s gives you security; it gives you comfort. It'so important to have a home. From a young age, it’s life-forming. It gives you stability, it gives It’s exactly that; it’s home. It’s your safe place. It’s your quiet place. It’s your personal space. If you don’t want to go and see anyone, you don’t need to do that.”
“I see my daughter quite often now. My son, he works ridiculous hours in hospitality so not so much, but they can come over now. I’ve got a permanent place so they’re not coming round and sitting with mates where I’m sleeping on the sofa.”
George is struggling with arthritis at the moment and is having to take some off from work. However, now that he has a tenancy agreement, he feels more secure.
“Certain things are not going according to plan at the moment [with my health], but I'm more protected with a tenancy agreement now and I'm not going to have to leave again. Without a legal binding agreement, you have no stability, no stability at all.”
He is passionate about ending homelessness and is calling the government to take action and build moresocial housing.
“We can end homelessness through more social housing. It’s that simple.”
“The next government need to put housing at the forefront of their mind. Having a home can improve people’s mental health, self-esteem, and their employment opportunities. When people are in the street, they are vulnerable. They are begging. Imagine the difference it could make if they had a home they could go back to, lock their door and be safe?”
“I want the government to think differently. There is a misconception. No one wants to be out in the street. No one. Because people’s self-esteem has been affected, the system has failed them or they need mental health support, they might be stuck in a cycle. They think they aren’t going to get the support that they need. They deserve to be treated with dignity.”
“To people who are taking action, I would say keep pushing, keep fighting, shout louder. Without the services that are provided by organisations like Crisis, this issue would be far more widespread. Recently, Section 21 have been overturned, which is incredible, but it wouldn’t have happened without years of campaigning.”*

*The Government has proposed scrapping section 21 evictions, also known as no-fault evictions. But the legislation to do so has not yet been passed.

King is an asylum seeker who lives in Newcastle. She was referred to Crisis by other organisations who have supported her and has been working with her lead worker, Emma.
King is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to the trauma she experienced in her life.She’s written a poem to raise awareness for the challenges she’s faced and is hoping the poem will be made into a song.
The poem talks about King’s challenges of vulnerability through persecution, experiencing homelessness, the fear of trying to be herself, childhood trauma, suicidal feelings and mental health. Although her recent journey has been one of hope and clarity as she’s been supported by a few charitable organisations.
King would like to acknowledge the charities below who have supported her through her difficult times:
‘’Place of the Unknown’’ - A poem by King
Long away from Home,Kept us safe,Protect us from danger,ln the front line,I thought it affect Soldiers in the Battlefields,They want the fight over,So they can go home.Nobody could see but it was there.
I'm starting to forget the sound of my voice,Questioning who am l,I miss the girl I used to be,Every twinkle in her eye,She takes my breath away,When she caress me,I can feel it in her touch,No one make me feel the way she did.Gaze into her eyes,I saw the whole world in front of me,Happiness and Beauty,That's all I could see,Hold me close,Kiss me all over,Leaves me wanting more,But I don't know why?
Am I out of my mind,Chasing my Rainbow,The Sun would shine through,Shouting out loud,Feel great Pride,Home is where my Love is,Everytime I am with her,I can't believe is true.
My brain seems to play tricks with me,Dancing around my head,Toying with my thoughts,Manoeuvring my mood swing,Pardon my explosive emotions,My battery went out of whack,Tries to bury them deep,Cos it drives me crazy.I just want the echoes in my head to go away,Feeling powerless,But how do I explain to her,Even though I know it is her hand touching me.But why my body can feel his?As long as I don't ask,Don't tell anyone,I will be fine.
Crush by the weight,Not knowing Right or Wrong,Black or White,With tears rolling down my face,Tears are words my heart can't say.
How will I explain to her,I have scars marked so deep that she can't see,Hidden away buried beneath the skin.
ln the middle of night,Scream out loud,But is out of my hand,Like reflection in a mirror.Everytime I closed my eyes,No idea why?It comes finds you,Replay over, over and over.I been here before,Searching for control,Desperate to stay afloat,I can't find my way out of it.I am not perfect,I will never be,But I want to tell her,I desire her.Unable to find words,I want her to touch me,Wrap her arms around me,Taste my lips,Love me,Don't give up on me!I don't know how to explain it,Getting close fires up my fear,If I broke down,Lost control of myself,Come and hold me,Until I stop shaking.Can I count on you,To bring me back,Here with you,Feeling close to you,Kiss my fear away.Though I can’t see,Whoever you maybe,Don’t judge me,Accept all of me,The real me!I don’t wanna scare you,So try to keep my distance,So you won’t see my pain,I don’t wanna burn you out.How will I explain to her,You see what I let you see,I’d been steering away from death countless time,Is so close,You don’t even know me.My mind freaks me out,Camouflaging myself,Ignore my feelings,My desire,Someone I don’t even recognise.Hiding in the shadow,I have no answer,Just questions?Constant battle,The culture,The norm,The tradition,The religion,The society,OrWhat the community expect of me,Just try to find myself.
Am I going bonkers?Dangerous terrain,Only way to stay sane,Rock the boat.
I am trouble,I am hard work,I am burden,When it matters the most,I felt betrayed,I had to go,I wasn’t safe,But run to where?
Like a tug of war,Back and forth,No direction,Struggling to let go and hold on,Held captive,So much past history,Being the one who left behind.
I am Frozen,I can see them,Their voice,Smell of their breath,Rob the very core of my being,How do I escape?Where do I flee?
Wishful thinking,Turn back the time,Fantasising,To get my life right,Set myself free or Keep in chained,Love is what I’ve got,Watch over me.
Searching for Rainbow,Searching for Sunshine,Searching for my life,And my Home to Me.
Force to let go,My Pride and Status.
Do you hear me,I know is a lot to ask,My heart lost in dark,How do I make it stop?This pain I feel,Swallow me whole,Pulls me like a magnet,Taking me away,Invade my space,I will never stop fighting back.
I am a human being after all,Searching for love,Searching for protection,Searching for comfort.
I can’t bear anyone to touch me,Shattered into pieces,The details lost in time,Fitting myself back together,Will always be a part of me.
I got nobody with me,Non Existence,Only the trails of crumbs,I feel like I am just watching life around me.
Wandering aimlessly,I have lost track,Where did the years go?Having No Where at all,No place to call Mine.
A deep hole,Never ending darkness,No light and No Exit,Fighting to breathe,Uncertainty of day by day living,With no particular destination to go.
A kindness of grandma once says to me,‘’Trouble, I see you and I am not going anywhere’’Never gave up asking ‘’Can I have a Hug’’The warmth embrace melts my heart to its core.
Caught in the mist,Reaching out,My final attempt,Ask for help,Became a minute by minute decision,Contemplating,No one has an answer because they can’t relate to.
So desperately holding onto,Fight not to lose,My last bit of sanity,It’s so hard,To pretend,That I am okay,But I have to,Put my mask on,Survival Mode.
Not connected,Not knowing what was wrong with me,Seeing everyday as my last,Hold onto what’s matter while I can.
Changing-Lives,Held my hand,Every step of the way,Out of the dark,I don’t see every step ahead.
But it felt right,I am ready,Let Love shine my way,I will take whatever Chance to get it right.
Running on empty,Feeling on Edge,I have no more word to describe,No way to turn,
Drop-in CRISIS,Feel like Home,Embrace All,Give me space to Hope,Learn me the Rope.
Bang the Drum,#Health Now Support,Find out what’s wrong,Mental Health problem.
Make the Difference,Like Life-Support,Healthcare involved.
Rainbow Migration,Let the colours of my life left behind flow through,Experience all the hues.
Freedom from Torture,Confront the Carnage,Prescription to mitigate the pain,To calm the storm in my mind.
Drew strength from All,In the face of adversity,While I still have time,Try to make the most.
Celebrating the Difference,Space for Everyone,Equality for All.
Stop questioning the Love I deserve,Hold my hand and don’t let it go,Feel my heart and you will know.
I dare you,Come closer,Don’t be scare,Your action show me you care,Not just words that you say,I have always known,You are my home.

”Where I have got myself out of homelessness, I want to help people that aren’t able to do that; to give them the support I never had.''
“The first year I volunteered with Crisis at Christmas, I let slip my birthday is on Boxing Day. The evening shift team handmade a card, and all the volunteers sung Happy Birthday. I felt loved and appreciated. Since then, I’ve never missed a year with Crisis. They’ve always encouraged me to go further: I’m now a senior volunteer, running shifts.”
Andrea, 35, has gained a degree in early childhood studies. She is also a Crisis peer researcher of systemic racism and homelessness, and a community advocate and organiser for causes including renters’ rights and anti-racism.
“I’ve stopped three evictions with Wandsworth Renters group. I’m a steward at a lot of marches, especially for the NHS – my grandma and mum came here to be nurses with the Windrush generation.”
Andrea has spent years fighting for a future for her and her daughter, who was born soon after Andrea’s mother got cancer.
“My dad died when I was four, so she was the main person in my life. I saw her on the operation bed, and it frightened me. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety -- my doctor wrote to the council and said, please don’t evict her, she’s trying to sort her life out. I was 18, I’d just had my daughter; I had to look after my sister, and it was just too much. That led onto me drinking and it spiralling out of control.''
“I was put in a hotel East Grinstead and expected to take my child to Battersea every day for school. It was literally one bedroom. There was no room for her to play; no parks nearby. It was either move her around with me or put her with my mum to get the stability she needed. But she was impacted: she didn’t have me. It was a nightmare that felt never-ending.”
Andrea had experienced domestic violence and rape.
“Eventually I got CBT therapy and I went to AA. That really helped. I was gradually doing things to improve my life and wanted to do that for others. I volunteered in children’s mental health. Then I worked for a local homelessness charity.”
“The most important thing now is to be present in my daughter’s life, I hope she achieves everything she wants – to act and go to America. If anyone deserves it, it’s her: she’s just amazing.”

“I was born in Yorkshire, but I’d spent most of my life in Africa. It’s huge, but there’s this continent-wide philosophy called Ubuntu, which is humanism. ‘I am because of who we all are.’ We’re interconnected.''
“I studied and worked as a journalist in Africa, and it was an amazing experience living there and travelling around.”
Andrew was forced into homelessness when he returned to England, at the age of 56.With the system being complicated, Andrew tells us “Very quickly I ran into all the red tape and the paperwork. I hadn’t been here, so I didn’t know how the system worked.''
“I stayed with my brother in Oxford, but he’s disabled so I couldn’t stay for long. I couldn’t find a job, and the only way I could get benefits support was to register as homeless. That was quite traumatic because I’ve always looked after myself.''
“You’ve got to get bank accounts, birth certificates, the whole thing. It’s very challenging, and for somebody who’s in a vulnerable situation, they get intimidated.”
Andrew sofa-surfed with friends, one of whom put him in touch with Crisis.“Crisis really helped me. They have a course called Renting Ready that tells you what you need to do to get on the housing list.  It gives you that step-by-step process.''
“I remember bidding for houses: you don't know where you're going to end up, which was a bit unsettling. But the person at the council phoned and said, ‘Andrew, there's a great place. Don't let it go.’ I said, ‘I'll take it’.''“It's clean, it's my little house. I've got a place and I'm warm.  And Crisis gave me a little start-up to buy some second-hand furniture. That's why it's nice to come back and do something."
Andrew has volunteered at Crisis Skylight Oxford since 2016.
“The people you meet here who are experiencing homelessness are sometimes the most amazing human beings. I’ve been involved with a project over Christmas, packing hampers full of toiletries, food and clothing. We’re doing this for people who really have their backs against a wall, and they say, ‘Don’t worry about me; give it to someone who’s really in need’. To me, that’s absolutely humbling. It brings me back again and again to help.''
“There's no need for homelessness in what’s purported to be one of the richest countries in the world. There's no excuse. Billions of pounds are being squandered, which could've housed everybody in this country. And this goes beyond England: there's always enough money for bombs and bullets. Now we've got people living on the street. Nobody wants to live on the street. So come on, government ...do something about it.”

Eddie was independent from a young age. After his mother died, he moved out of his crowded family home in Guinea-Bissau and found a job as a carpenter. By 15 years old, he was renting his own place to live.
Eddie’s father was Portuguese, so he had EU citizenship. He moved over to the UK to be with one of his brothers over a decade ago.
Eddie worked as a chef in luxurious London hotels, but he developed a skin condition and was forced to leave his job. “I want to work, I’ve always worked in this country, I never stopped. It’s just this time because of my situation. My doctor said I can’t work more than five hours because it’s true, anytime I stress, even if I’m working, it gets worse.”
When he lost his job, he spent all of his savings on rent. Eventually, he had to leave his flat. He stayed with a friend for a while. “I was sleeping on a wooden floor - no carpet.” His friend had a large family and it was crowded. He asked Eddie to leave after a few weeks.
“I was sleeping on the street for nine days.” Fortunately, Eddie was referred to one of the Crisis at Christmas hotels. In the hotel, Eddie was able to access the support he needed.
He had lost his phone on the bus, and Crisis provided a new one. “I can talk to people. I’m using Google to check things, like for work. And I can watch boxing videos!”
His skin condition is much better now too. He hadn’t been able to get to a doctor for a while, but when he was at the hotel, he was sent to a doctor and was able to start taking his medication again. He hadn't taken any medication for months before he came to Crisis at Christmas.
Eddie was given a Crisis coach, who supported him to find somewhere to rent. “I got a house already! I got a house yesterday, I have a contract. I’m just waiting for furniture.” Crisis sourced a bed, wardrobe and things for the kitchen.
Eddie is now settled in his new home and looking forward to the future. Once he feels better, he hopes to find a new job.
“If it wasn’t for Crisis, I might have died. I tried so many times to get Universal Credit but they kept rejecting me. Crisis sorted it out.”

Before Christmas, Sammy was worried about the future. “When I was in the hotel, it was good. It made a lot of difference to my life. I was not worried about what might happen. I felt safe in the hotel and that I would be OK.”
Sammy loves reading, especially Catherine Cookson novels. “I like games too, like jigsaw puzzles and sudoku and other crosswords and word games.” The hotel was a chance to relax and be herself. “I could see people. There was lots of stuff to do.”
Sammy was made homeless when her home was burned down. “I was sent to a hostel. My grandfather was put in a place for people with dementia.”
Sammy grew up in Dominica, where she studied literature and sociology. “I worked as a teacher, teaching small children. I enjoyed that.” At 30, she had a stroke. “I moved back in with my father and I was in and out of hospital for a while. I couldn’t go back to teaching. I couldn’t do anything like I could do before. It affected my speech too.”
Six years ago, Sammy came to the UK. “I came here to try and have a better life. I was hoping that I could find some other kind of work.” Sammy’s immigration status was never settled, so she has not been able to work. It also meant she could not access any public support when the fire destroyed her home.
“I found out about Crisis when I was in the hostel. I came to the Crisis hotel in December and I stayed there for a month.”
“My room was good. The food was excellent. The people working there, the volunteers – they were great.”
Sammy was able to get more help and support at the hotel. “I went to see the podiatrist who helped me with my feet and offered me shoes that have helped me. I had a cut on my foot. I didn’t have any good shoes, so they made a real difference.”
She was assigned a coach with St Mungos, who partnered with Crisis to deliver some of the advice in the Crisis at Christmas hotels. They helped her apply for the right to remain.
“I’m currently waiting for my immigration status to be settled.” She has somewhere safe to stay while her application is processed. “It’s nice where I am now.”

Before Andrei’s Crisis Coach referred him to a Crisis at Christmas hotel in December 2021, he was forced to sleep on the streets.
“I felt very scared. From the moment you put your head down and fall asleep, you can’t control anything around you. Usually, I wouldn’t sleep at all.” Sleep-deprived, cold and hungry, he got sick and ended up in hospital.
Andrei had been pushed into homelessness by a series of events, triggered by the pandemic. He had moved to the UK five years ago to build a better life. “I tried different jobs in Romania, but it’s pretty hard to get a job with decent wages to build a future, a life, a family.”
He settled in London, found a job in a warehouse, and a room in a house with a live-in landlady – an elderly woman who Andrei grew fond of. Andrei’s life was stable and comfortable until the pandemic hit.
Andrei had just finished one contract and was waiting for another to start when COVID restrictions came into force. Businesses were reducing staff numbers to allow for social distancing, and his role was cut.
He worked in another small warehouse for a while, but more and more employees started to fall ill with COVID and so they reduced their workforce, and he lost his job again.Without a steady source of income, Andrei was unable to pay his rent. His live-in landlord eventually locked him out. He hadn’t signed a formal tenancy agreement, so he had very few rights.
Andrei slept on a friend’s sofa for two weeks but then was forced to sleep on the streets. He knew he needed help, so he searched online and found Crisis. He was put in touch with Crisis Coach Lorna, who helped to connect him with other services in his area and secured him a room at a Crisis at Christmas hotel.
Working with Crisis, Andrei was supported to apply for Universal Credit, receive emergency phone credit and a bus pass. He now has a network of caseworkers who he’s in touch with on a regular basis and he credits Lorna for making it all happen. Andrei is now housed in a one-bedroom flat council flat in a nice development where he is happy. He is waiting to be placed in his own permanent property.
After a few nights in the hotel, Andrei went back to visit the spot where he used to sleep. “I went back, freshly showered and without my heavy backpack, and I felt different. I didn’t feel scared anymore. All that pressure, all that weight was gone. And now I can focus on my next steps.”
