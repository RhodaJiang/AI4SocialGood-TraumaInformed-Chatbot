# AI4SocialGood-TraumaInformed-Chatbot

A behavioural-science-informed, trauma-aware decision-support chatbot for UK homelessness services.  
It helps frontline workers identify potential trauma risks and provides ethically responsible guidance, supporting staff onboarding, skills development, and fostering a trauma-informed organisational culture.

---

## Overview

This project develops a **behavioural-science-informed, trauma-aware decision-support chatbot** for UK homelessness services.  
The model enables frontline workers to:

- Identify potential trauma risks in real-world scenarios.
- Receive guidance on responding in a trauma-informed and ethically responsible way.

The tool is designed to support:

- Onboarding of new staff.
- Upskilling of unqualified personnel.
- Fostering individual practice improvement and wider organisational culture change.

---

## Background

Although societal attention to marginalised populations has increased, trauma-informed practice remains inconsistent in homelessness services.  
This project aims to bridge that gap through a transparent, ethically grounded AI system aligned with professional social work values.

---

## Data

- **Source**: 100 publicly available case examples from UK homelessness service organisations.  
- **Structure**: Each case includes multiple scenarios.  
- **Process**: Dataset development is fully documented in this repository.  
- **Ethics**: All data is publicly available; identifying details have been removed or anonymised.  

---

## Methodology

- **Model type**: Domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM) / chatbot.  
- **Approach**: Combination of expert human responses (from trained social workers) and AI-generated responses.  
- **Alignment**: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to embed professional social work values and trauma-informed principles.  

---

## Goals

- Provide practical, evidence-informed decision support for frontline workers.  
- Embed trauma-informed and ethical practice in AI tools for social care.  
- Contribute to the *AI for Social Good* movement.

# Ethics Self-Assessment Statement  

**Project Title:**  
*Adapting Domain-Specific Large Language Models for Trauma-Informed Decision Support in Frontline Homelessness Services (Pilot Study)*  

---

## Research Context  
This pilot study explores the feasibility of adapting a domain-specific large language model (LLM) to provide trauma-informed and ethically responsible decision support for frontline homelessness practitioners.  

---

## Data Sources  
- Case materials were drawn from **publicly available reports and resources** published by UK homelessness organisations.  
- All materials were obtained through **web scraping of publicly accessible websites**.  
- No private, restricted, or confidential data were collected.  

---

## Anonymisation and Sensitivity  
- The original texts may contain **sensitive descriptions of homelessness, trauma and vulnerability**.  
- To minimise risk, all identifiable information (e.g. names, locations, organisational details) has been **removed during data cleaning**.  
- Only **de-identified and structured case scenarios** are retained for analysis and model training.  

---

## Use of Data  
- The dataset will be used **exclusively for academic research and pilot experimentation**.  
- The **raw scraped materials will *not* be publicly released**.  
- Only **processed, anonymised, and synthetic examples** will be shared to ensure transparency without compromising privacy.  

---

## Ethical Risks and Mitigation  
- **Risk of harmful model outputs** → mitigated by implementing a **fail-safe mechanism** that instructs the model to defer to human supervisors when uncertain.  
- **Risk of misinterpretation by practitioners** → mitigated by including **clear disclaimers** in prototype outputs emphasising that the tool is for research purposes only and *not a substitute for professional judgement*.  
- **Risk of reinforcing bias or stigma** → mitigated through **collaboration with social work experts** in dataset annotation and evaluation, ensuring alignment with social work ethics and trauma-informed principles.  

---

## Ethics Review Status  
- As this is an **unfunded pilot study** conducted with **publicly available data**, no formal institutional review board (IRB) approval was sought.  
- This self-assessment demonstrates **active engagement with ethical considerations** and alignment with best practice in responsible AI and social work research.  

---

## Commitment to Transparency  
- All **data handling protocols**, **annotation guidelines**, **model training scripts**, and **ethical documentation** will be made openly accessible.  
- Research outputs will be explicitly marked as *in progress* and *for academic purposes only*.
