Emily is a lone parent with mental health issues, she was referred by the Early Help team who were assisting her with parenting issues around the eldest child who also has mental health issues. Emily had just started receiving ESA and had debts, notably water arrears and a tax credit overpayment. She was struggling to deal with bills and ongoing expenditure.
The Transition Adviser assisted Emily to apply for Disabled Living Allowance for her daughter. She was awarded middle rate care component and following further advice, her child tax credit also increased with the additional of the child disability element. Following referral to Water Debt Gateway, we assisted her to successfully apply for the Watersure tariff which halved her ongoing water bill. In addition, we secured a grant towards the arrears of nearly £1700. We assisted Emily to challenge the tax credit overpayment on the grounds that she could not afford repayments. HMRC eventually agreed to write off her liability.

Tony was 17 years of age and attended college full time when we first met him. Tony has Special Educational Needs and receives high levelPersonal Independence Payments (PIP).
Tony lived with his mother and her boyfriend who regularly
fought. Tony has  brothers who are all
older, unemployed and regularly smoke marijuana. Tony’s mother and her
boyfriend are often away for months at a time leaving him in the care of his
three older brothers. Tony described a life of fear where his brothers used to
bully him, his mother had full control over his finances and didn’t give him
any of his money.
When we first met Tony his clothes were tatty, he was
unkempt and unhappy. Tony told me that he was scared and that he didn’t like
being at home.
Tony wanted to move out and after several conversations it
became clear that he had a close female friend who he often stayed with when
things went wrong. Her name is Sarah. Sarah also has Special Educational Needs
and lives with her parents who offer her care and support. Sarah’s mother had a
spare room and was happy for Tony to stay there.
With support from the project we prepared a licence agreement, applied forUniversal Credit,Bursary at college and to change the PIP payments over to Tony as he was no longer living at home.
Unfortunately this process was not easy. Tony’s mother refused to take her name off as his appointee for PIP, college and the project had a meeting with her where we informed her we would be making a referral to adult social care and advising Tony to go to the police as this is a criminal offence as he had just turned 18.
Following several conversations with DWP we arranged a
meeting for them to come out and visit Tony to assess his needs.
We attended Tony’s initial meeting forUniversal Credit,with him and Sarah’s Mum. The work coach had no understanding of his additional needs and his inability to work full time. We were told that we needed a doctor’s letter that stated he could not work.
Following on from these meetings an appointment with CAB was
made as it seemed unfair that they expected Tony to work full time, not claim
any living expenses.
After a few further meetings, we were able to secure housing benefit throughUniversal Credit,a doctor wrote a letter stating that Tony couldn’t work, He applied for his driving licence, changed his addresses, is now in receipt of hisPIP(with guidance from Sarah’s Mum) has his own licence agreement, and has applied for a bursary through college.
Tony is in contact with his Mother, however she has now
moved out of the country and is no longer playing an active role in his life.

Concerned about someone?
“I was so angry when I moved into Mawle Court. I had to move out of my previous property where I could have my kids to stay, to a one-bedroom flat where children weren’t allowed on site.
It felt so unfair and I realise now that I took my anger out on anyone and everyone – particularly the staff. I didn’t really want to engage with them or listen to what they had to say. For a whole year I would get into arguments with other residents, avoid my keywork sessions and I got into arrears with my service charge.
The team at Mawle Court were persistent in trying to get me to engage. Eventually I realised they were on my side and I gradually learned to trust them. I would agree to their suggestions and support, but I was still so frustrated at not being able to see my kids on a regular basis that I didn’t really act on any of it. I suppose at that point I was just engaging on a surface level, and I was still in arrears.
I started asking staff how and when I would be able to move on to another property where I could have my children to stay. The team explained to me that we couldn’t begin the process until I’d engaged properly with my keywork sessions and paid off my arrears.
This gave me the motivation I needed to start making some changes. The team wanted me to succeed in my goal and they worked with me to overcome my anger issues, finding new ways to approach frustrations and disagreements.
I paid off all my owing service charge, and quite soon after beginning the housing application process my case was prioritised as Band 2, meaning my housing need was seen as urgent.
But the process still took a really long time and it was really hard to cope with the delay. A year before I would have let the rage take over but I have changed a lot and I was able to handle my frustration in a more productive way.
With the support of my support worker I was also able to come up with a savings plan so I could save money for a deposit and some furniture ready for my new property.
After staying there for two years I moved out of Mawle Court into my new home. I feel like I’ve changed as a person and I feel so proud to be able to provide a home where my children can come and stay so we can spend more time together.”

Concerned about someone?
Like so many women experiencing homelessness, Gina sought security in a relationship – but that relationship soon became abusive. Women-only supported housing is a vital resource for women like Gina who have experienced gender-based violence. But without 24/7 staffing, we can’t provide the wraparound support they need to hold their door against abusers.
By supporting ourHer Way Home appeal, you can help us change Gina’s story.
As a child, Gina witnessed domestic violence in the home and when she was 14 years old her mother was detained under the Mental Health Act. At this young age, she was left to look after herself – taking herself to school and returning to an empty house. Later, she had two children and lived with them in social housing before a traumatic incident took its toll on her mental health.
Gina began using alcohol and drugs as she struggled to cope with the impact of her experiences. This led to her children being taken into care, another traumatic event that only deepened her depression and her addictions. She lost her social housing, went to prison and moved through two different hostels. Then, Gina came to Homeless Oxfordshire’s Women’s Project.
Over several months of dedicated work, her social worker built up a relationship with Gina and was able to help her focus on her goal of keeping in contact with her children. Our staff supported her to engage with her GP about her mental health and accompanied her to appointments. They also managed to get her scripted at Turning Point and put her forward for Housing First. Gina later decided she wanted to attend rehab, and, with our help, she completed her application.
With peer support from other Women’s Project residents and access to self-esteem building opportunities, such as taking part in art classes and going to the hairdressers, Gina was making good progress towards rebuilding her life. That is until an existing relationship with an abusive partner began affecting her safety and the wellbeing of other residents at the property.
Despite intensive support, Gina’s relationship with this partner continued. And as current funding only covers weekday staffing at the Women’s Project, our only option was to refer Gina into a hostel where more security was in place. However, we know from experience that a mixed hostel environment can be detrimental to the wellbeing and recovery of women like Gina, whose past experiences make them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
Bring housing, healing and hope to women experiencing homelessness in Oxfordshire.
With your help, we can introduce 24/7 wraparound support in our women-only accommodation so women like Gina can continue to build up their self-worth and rediscover their independence.

Read more about Faye and other residents’ stories in ourlatest impact report.
“When I came to Homeless Oxfordshire I was very depressed and my confidence was at rock bottom. I had just gone through a very difficult break up from an abusive marriage and I just couldn’t cope. I was worried about what would happen when I came out of hospital.
When I was discharged I was referred into the Homeless Oxfordshire Step Down program and was given a support worker and my own flat. I finally felt safe for the first time in years.
When you’re in a situation like the one I’d been in, it’s hard to know where to start rebuilding your life or how to do it. Having the confidence to take that first step or to trust new people was a real challenge.
At the Step-Down project I had regular one-to-one sessions with my support worker, and the team showed me consistency, which I needed. Slowly I felt more able to let my guard down and began to open up to the team there, which was a big step for me.
I took part in lots of the activities at the project like Tai Chi and gardening which helped me build my confidence. I started cooking with the staff and even helped cook Christmas dinner for everyone. It was such a boost to my self-esteem and helped me start to feel independent again.
I started feeling stronger and began to grow as a person. My support worker suggested I enrol on a dog grooming college course. It’s not something I would have ever thought of doing before but I completed the course and plan to begin a new career in that field. I had support to apply for my own property through Homechoice and I can’t wait to move in to my new home and begin living my best life.
It’s been a long journey for me which was made easier because of the team at the Step Down project. I am so grateful to them for helping me to rebuild my life.”

Concerned about someone?
As the county’s largest provider of supported accommodation for people experiencing homelessness, Homeless Oxfordshire is acutely aware of the pressures facing local authorities, statutory services and housing providers.
Since 2021, Oxfordshire has seen a64% risein the number of households experiencing homelessness. There has also been an unprecedented rise in people being placed in expensive and often inappropriate temporary accommodation.
We support the people behind these statistics. We get to know their individual stories and the circumstances that have contributed towards their homelessness. We walk with them, supporting them when they need us, enabling them to rebuild their lives and move on from homelessness.
One of these people is Cheryl*, who, with our support, overcame domestic abuse and addiction challenges to enter into rehab. She is now nearing completion of rehab and is working towards making a fresh start for herself, with hopes of being reunited with her children.
However, we see on a daily basis the barriers people like Cheryl face when they are ready to move on from our supported accommodation into their own home. The social and affordable housing they need is simply not available. This causes a delay to their move to independence and adds additional, unnecessary strain on the services, like ours, that have to bridge this gap.
Whilst many factors are contributing to the housing crisis, the underlying issue has been a lack of social and truly affordable housebuilding.Shelter’s recent reportsuggests that in 2022/23 we saw a net loss of 11,684 social homes across England.
Homeless Oxfordshire are supportive of any building scheme that will increase the social and affordable housing stock in Oxfordshire, and we urge housing providers and local councils to consider the wider benefit to society of any such scheme and the ways it will help deliver the social and affordable housing our county and people like Cheryl so desperately need.

“Probably the most helpful aspects of the support I received was the continuity of care and support – and a persistent key worker, which I needed. I was supported to detox and then referred into a housing project, where I am doing well.
I feel if it weren’t for the support I had received from my Housing Support Worker I may well have lost my life, as my physical health was seriously deteriorating.
I feel eternally grateful for the care and support I received from Homeless Oxfordshire. Today my life is good. I am nearly two years abstinent from drugs, I have rebuilt my relationship with my daughter and my grandson, I have addressed medical issues, I have made good solid friendships and I have learnt to trust people and accept help. I have also completed a peer mentoring programme and received an accredited certificate.
I volunteer for services as I would like to give a bit back. I have gratitude and a real sense of purpose and value to my life now. My self-worth and self-confidence have much improved and I am starting to feel whole again.”

Concerned about someone?
“My motivation for being here was wanting better for myself and for my children. I really didn’t want to come back to my area with the same mindset and behaviours I’d had previously.
For me one of the most helpful aspects is having a nice homely environment, especially after coming from treatment centres and rehabilitation units. Support from staff and my peers has been extremely positive. It’s helped me achieve my goals that I set at the start of my tenancy with Homeless Oxfordshire, whereas previously I was fearful, ambivalent and resistant to making changes. The weekly group work sessions meant I was able to explore issues that I hadn’t felt comfortable exploring before. I was able to build my self-esteem, self-confidence and self-worth.
In the past year, my whole attitude to life has completely changed. I have learnt to trust people and build positive relationships with my family and solid friendships with people who care and value me for who I am today.
I have routine and structure to my week. I have completed the peer mentoring group with The Women’s Project and am now a peer mentor for them. In this role I facilitate groups, which I really enjoy, and I’m looking forward to doing some more peer mentoring with Homeless Oxfordshire.
I now have continued unsupervised contact with my children and I’m able to help my mother, who has been consistently supportive and is guardian of my three children. I have a positive relationship with my son’s social worker and I’m able to take my children on holiday unsupervised as their social workers can see how well I have done. There has been no further offending and all my previous offending history is now all spent.
My next steps will be to work with staff regarding moving on, to continue doing peer mentoring and to save for a holiday with my children. Eventually, I want to move on and work towards future employment, possibly in the care sector or something similar.”

Concerned about someone?
I had always been a heavy drinker in my life, but it had never caused me any real issues. I was living with my father, who was diagnosed with cancer, which was about 10 years ago now. Sadly, he died because of it.
I had to watch him go through all of that, it was a really hard time, and I turned to drink to cope.  My drinking became a real problem. I withdrew from everything, from everyone.
I still went to work at first, the bills were being paid, but I was drinking heavily and it was a real issue that I just couldn’t face.
The drinking gradually caught up with me, by then I had stopped paying the rent, and got behind with everything and had lots of debt. I was blinded by my own thoughts and feelings.
I lost the flat because of my rent arrears,
Suddenly I’m homeless, I didn’t know what to do, or who to turn to. I’d never been in this situation before I was quite alone and very scared.
I was fortunate that my elder brother sort of picked up that something was not going right, with his support and his wife they helped me get in contact with outreach who help people who are homeless and sleeping rough on the streets. I was lucky to have their help.
I had a brief interview with them gave them some details and they managed to get me into the night shelter on SWEP at O’Hanlon House. Which is where you get somewhere to sleep at night so you’re not out in the cold in the winter, and then sit up where they provided you somewhere to stay at night.
Being on the streets was really horrible. Staying on the streets is scary and horrible, it’s not nice for anyone.Homeless Oxfordshire gave me a support worker, I was given a room in one of the projects called pre-recovery.I moved in there I got my own room it was fantastic! It’s great to have my own space my own room and privacy after having nothing.It was still quite scary at first, being in a house with six other strangers and trying to cope with things again.
I was in pre-recovery for about six months once you get used to it you settle down and it’s quite nice and that.It’s so much better than being on the streets!One decision I did make when I first moved in was that I needed to stop drinking. That’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life.
I couldn’t control the drinking and I knew I had to stop! There is no way I could continue the way I was. I did stop drinking because I was given access by Homeless Oxfordshire to a programme to help me with my addiction issue. Having proved that I wasn’t drinking anymore and that I wanted to change things while I was there, I got offered a place for a dry house called the Sapling project. Here, life was a lot more stable than I was used to because in the other place people were often still using substances to manage the trauma in their lives.
I stayed at Sapling for just over 18 months.
I was able to take on a volunteer role whilst still working to overcome on my addiction. I had quite a nice structure to my life. One of the best things was that I used my time to get my driving licence back, and then was able to progress to getting my housing application in.
Getting on the housing list was tough because of my rent arrears from before, it took a long time to be accepted.
Throughout all of this Homeless Oxfordshire was a constant offering a place to stay whilst I worked really hard to improve my life. I proved that I was able to pay off my debts and was able to get onto the housing register.
Obviously with COVID things were taking longer than normal fortunately I was very very patient.I was able to get a part-time job with the maintenance department at Homeless Oxfordshire which was a milestone for me and a great step to getting full-time work.
Out of the blue, I got a phone call from the housing officer saying there was a flat available. I was over the moon, I wasn’t expecting it but at long last, the flat was there. I viewed it, I signed it and I moved in January this year.
I now have a full-time job, my own little flat, and a car. I love my work, I love the people I work with I’ve made lots of friends over the last three years. It’s been an interesting journey obviously highs and lows a lot more highs than lows. It has been a struggle at times but I’m here now. I’m happy with everything I’ve done and everything has been worthwhile. My perseverance has paid off and well that’s my journey over the last three years from homelessness to where I am now and as they say the rest is history……
Homeless Oxfordshire has helped me not just with my housing issues but supported me throughout with my alcohol addiction, giving advice on who to see and financial support with benefits, grants etc.
I was able to get a part-time job with the maintenance department at Homeless Oxfordshire which was a milestone for me and a great step to getting full-time work.
Undoubtedly they have been the backbone of my journey over the last 3 years so I am very thankful to not just the support staff but all the many people I’ve met on the way.

Concerned about someone?
At Homeless Oxfordshire, we want to end homelessness, not manage it. That’s why we work hard to support people out of homelessness for good. We provide a safe space to those that have found themselves homeless, with access to high quality one to one support and initiatives to give them control and independence. In this post, we discuss Eddy’s story.
Eddy came to us for help in 2001 after he was unable to stay in the Night Shelter, due to his age at the time. As soon as Eddy turned 25, he sought shelter in our old single-story building, where he slept in a dorm. Back then, our beginning was humble. In a shabby old school building, named Oxford Night Shelter, we provided overnight emergency accommodation to anyone that needed a warm bed and a roof over their head.
It was far from ideal. But we used what we had and gave it our all. We transformed classrooms into dormitories and provided everyone with food, washing facilities and as much support as possible. At night, Eddy remembered taking his shoes off and putting them in a pillowcase to keep them safe.
We helped Eddy get into the Luther Street Medical Centre as he was a drug user. We support the work of the Luther Street Medical Centre, through leasing a building to the Clinical Commissioning Group. The centre was founded as a direct response to the lack of health services for those that find themselves homeless.
Eddy was sent to rehab near Blackpool. However, he found it very difficult as this was for predominantly ex-offenders. Eddy was asked to leave the rehab centre in Blackpool and he came back to Oxford, once again staying at the Night Shelter. He remembers watching tv in the main room and says that the old facility was nowhere near as good as what is offered now. Hesays our rooms are like hotel rooms now.
We supported Eddy and helped him into a new programme at Walton street for rehabilitation, afterwards he moved on to London, where he completed the programme.
The most amazing part of this story is, using our support, his hard work and perseverance paid off. Eddy gained a new life and is now a teacher, living in a nice area of London. He teaches EFL and has been married for 5 years. Eddy is very grateful for the help and support he received and says he would have died without it. He will always be so pleased that he came to Homeless Oxfordshire.
We’ve been able to help people like Eddy who have become homeless this year with your support and many others still need your help…
Just £25would enable us in this time of crisis to carry on providing stable, positive & safe accommodation, individual support, exercise, self-belief and calm emotions.

Story 11
Source: https://homelessoxfordshire.uk/2022/01/26/emmas-story-survival/

Concerned about someone?
At this young age, Emma decided that it was her job to protect her brothers and sisters and to provide a safe, stable future for them all. So, she tried hard at school and was the first person in her family to go to University where she trained to be a teacher.
Emma is an intelligent, articulate woman who found herself in an unavoidable situation. So she had to make a decision early on about how to survive.
As she moved into her early 20’s, she began to display traits of manic depression, an illness that was undiagnosed for a long time. It was then misdiagnosed as postnatal depression. Emma continued to work and raise a family for twenty years and, despite being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder, Emma became drug and alcohol dependent.
Although she was still holding down a job and supporting her family, Emma became increasingly exposed to domestic abuse from her partner. On the outside Emma was a typical middle class professional who seemed to have it all. But behind closed doors she became more and more emotionally unstable, and ended up having what many would term a ‘mental breakdown’.
After this, Emma’s addiction problems led to recurring bouts of psychosis and she was completely engulfed in hopelessness; feeling lost and worthless. She suffered from two illnesses and was blamed by her partner for causing the problems and provoking the abuse herself. The vicious cycle of addiction was exacerbated by the hostile controlling environment she lived in.
“It was like being on a constant treadmill not being able to get off, but I realised I had to make a choice either leave and recover or stay and sink further. It was not easy to believe it is possible to live a life without chemical peace of mind, especially as it was the solution I had been using to cope with the emotional pain. I had no idea if it was possible to override the overwhelming desire to ‘use’, I had been self medicating for such a long long time in one form or another. I didn’t really know that I was an addict until I tried to stop drinking on my own”.
Through the Women’s support group at harm minimisation, she was referred to ‘Lifeline’: Oxford’s only Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service that operates a Community Rehab and a 12 Step sobriety course. Emma finally felt that she had found a way to get out of the cycle of addiction and to try to get her life back on track.
In August 2014, Emma realised that she had to find help and a way out for both her sake and the sake of her children. So with amazing resilience and strength she left her home and started sofa-surfing at a friend’s house. However, her partner followed her and intimidated her friend so she had to leave and started sleeping in her car.
Crisis Skylight Oxford was her first contact with local homeless services. She once again started a period of sobriety and friends agreed to put her up for 3 months during this time.  Emma was then referred to Homeless Oxfordshire via their Community Housing assisted living service and was given a place in sober living accommodation in May 2015 – at this time Emma was 9 months sober.
” – it gave me consistency. Dependence is the hardest thing to talk about and it’s even harder asking for help. As an intelligent, educated and articulate woman I felt that I should have been able to deal with my situation. I was so grateful to have the 1 to 1 support of my key worker who helped build trust in my relationships with people. She also encouraged me to seek support in the Oxford Mutual aid fellowships (A.A. and NA) because I was so terrified of relapse. I continue to attend weekly meetings at Drug Addicts Anonymous and found a sponsor who helps support me in my recovery- I haven’t needed to use since.”
Homelessness is something that society often views as self-inflicted, which is simply not the case. Homelessness is an uncomfortable subject – mainly because it reminds all of us that our lives are finely balanced and it would only take certain circumstances or situations for us to find ourselves in the same situation as Emma.

At 15 years old, Izzy left her family home. Her house had a chaotic environment, one where she had suffered years of emotional and physical abuse. There came a point when she’d had enough. Living on the streets, Izzy was isolated. She didn’t have a support network around her and she turned to unhealthy substances as a way of coping. When she was at her most vulnerable, she became pregnant and her child was taken into care.
From the moment Izzy walked through our doors at Homeless Oxfordshire, we worked on her strengths.We found that she had a flair for creative writing, so we encouraged her to start journaling.

A breakdown in communication between me and my family. The family way of life was not how it should have been, lots of arguments, my girlfriend’s uncle beat me up and my mother wanted me to call the police but I didn’t so she kicked me out. I became homeless, staying in crack houses, tents, abandoned buildings, selling drugs to survive. I made my life for the last 6 years from drug dealing.
Mentally – my mental wellbeing was in a really low spot. I split up with my girlfriend which became a positive because it helped me to stand on my own two feet. I kept pushing myself to have a drive to get out of it. If it was not for the Vineyard I would probably have still been drug dealing as I did not have enough drive on my own to pull myself out of it. I didn’t have very high hopes for getting myself out of my situation. My family relationships started getting better once I moved into the Vineyard. I did not think that would have happened. I never used to really speak to them too much as I was in my own little world.
Stop taking drugs. I have been clean off all this for about a year. I still have the occasional beer!
The support of Tom. He has been absolutely amazing. If I ever needed someone to talk too Tom was always there to listen and help. It’s the little things in life that you don’t always realise are there until they are not there.
Understanding the letters I am getting. before I would just lose my temper and get angry when I got them, but Tom would help me to understand them and think more rationally about how I needed to respond.
Having no support until I got contact with outreach. It’s hard to understand homelessness if you have never been there and how to reach out for support. I didn’t know about the outreach services or who to call. This information needs to be made more available. It might help reduce getting into substance abuse on the streets because when you don’t know much you can find yourself hanging around with drug addicts and then get caught up in that, if the outreach services were known sooner it could help prevent this.
Having a phone was helpful. It’s quite difficult to receive support if you do not have a phone number.
Much gratitude and appreciation was given to Harry for kindly providing this interview.

Story 14

Concerned about someone?
At the end of 2019, we spoke to *Lucy, one of our brave clients who shared her experiences of homelessness and substance misuse.We caught up with her and she told us how her recovery has been progressing.
Before becoming homeless, Lucy had been to university and after graduating, spent a number of years working successfully a recruitment consultant.
Lucy’s story is evidence that homelessness doesn’t discriminate; nor does ill-mental health and addiction. We spoke to her to find out how she is doing and she told us, in a way that only she can articulate (and what an eloquent lady she is):
2019 is a tad hazy, the majority of which I spent living in the Women’s Project with five other women. I drifted through pockets when I acted as a functional humanoid…  other pockets of time I spent in bed, in a puddle of bodily fluid, sweating out vodka, waiting for death to gobble me up…
In the here and now, that seems like a million miles away… but it isn’t… if I take my eye off the recovery ball.
The Women’s Project gave the five of us some individuality, in a place we came to call home.
We could pause, take a breath. Our guards didn’t have to be up… We were trusted to be responsible and attempt at ‘adulting’ “playing house”, in a way. A house with a front door, which we all had keys to. A home with two sofas, fluffy pillows, picture frames, positive affirmations hanging on the walls. We had a hoover, a bathroom mat, fresh flowers, occasionally.
As a group, our key workers Jenny and Kelly would pop round with biscuits and we all sit and have weekly catch-up chats. Their positivity was infectious, their creative ways to encourage us to express our feelings and open up, just to each other, brilliant. From defacing and refacing blank masks, to mood boards, self-care afternoons or day trips, it was blooming beautiful.
I wouldn’t say any of us were natural ‘home makers’, (I definitely wouldn’t nominate ANY of us for house-wife of the year) but one thing was for sure, we were all there for each other. The support was always there and slowly but surely, I began to trust the ladies. I hadn’t trusted myself in a very long time, let alone trusted myself to get vulnerable with others.
It was at the Women’s Project that I first made baby steps towards freedom from addictions, by letting my guard down with some of the ladies I shared with.
The women gave me newfound freedom from any doubt or suspicion that my words would not be used against me, that my tears weren’t a sign of weakness but of strength.
I’m not yet there on the whole self-belief thing, I have a long way to go on that one in fact, but it’s work in constant motion. As my body was so dependent on alcohol that any attempt at cutting down on alcohol, would typically end with me in hospital. I had fits and seizures in the street, in the house, at Waitrose (one minute I was carrying a watermelon, exchanging pleasantries with Paul, the guy at the deli counter, the next, I’m waking up at the JR, tubes everywhere, minus the watermelon).
Kelly, head of the Women’s Project, worked tirelessly with Turning Point to secure me a place at a women’s rehabilitation centre. Once again, I was shown another step to recovery.”
“Yes I lost hope. I still lose it, but I am never far from a housemate to pick me up. I still have a note that my key worker Tamsin left in my journal, as throughout a particularly trying time, I began to doubt whether there was any real point in dreaming.
“Why am I here?
What do I want?
What have I felt?”
Simple right? Three very poignant yet seemingly simple questions, which made me think, they still do.
I text her regularly, just with updates… I must remind myself daily or even hourly, on tough days, of where I am going.
Learning lessons does not ever end, every day is a school day.
What I make of my life, is essentially up to me…
Only with a sober, clear head, can any attempt at living life on life’s terms really be made.
So I continue on, day in and day out, trying to decide what to make of my life. What I think it is, what it will be.
Although I continue practising the fine art of being ‘present’, in the moment, on purpose, I continue to struggle with depression and anxiety.
I am working with a sponsor, to go through the 12 steps around both food and alcohol.
I battle with an anorexic mind with bulimic tendencies on a daily basis.
My sobriety date was the 19th of September, which also happened to be my birthday, so I will be 36 but more importantly, one year sober, for the first time EVER!!!!!!
In other news, I now have a part-time job in a hospital.
I LOVE it… If things work out, pigs fly and miracles continue to happen, I will apply for a postgraduate degree in mental health nursing in 2021…
I would love to work in homeless/ addiction services as a mental health nurse, helping those who are in similar positions as I have been.
Watch this space…
Moving on to me is a stab at independent living, something which I haven’t done in years. A home, with neighbours, maybe some basil in a pot on the windowsill. Buying my own fridge, can you imagine?? A bed, choosing a colour to paint the living room. Moving on to me, is acceptance of self, of a commitment to a future.
The things I’m not quite there with?
The people that addiction has taken from this life, way too soon.
I leave you with a poem Tamsin gave me, that I still have on my wall.
The Summer DayWho made the world?Who made the swan, and the black bear?Who made the grasshopper?This grasshopper, I mean-the one who has flung herself out of the grass,the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down-who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.I do know how to pay attention, how to fall downinto the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,which is what I have been doing all day.Tell me, what else should I have done?Doesn’t everything die at last, and too soon?Tell me, what is it you plan to dowith your one wild and precious life?
—Mary Oliver
UPDATE – Lucy contacted us again in October 2020 to inform us that she had successfully secured a private rental agreement. We are immensely proud of her.

Concerned about someone?
Becoming homeless
“I was with someone who was stupidly doing heroin and I tried it. This led me down the path of losing my house, family. I was sofa surfing, so just going anywhere that anyone would put me up really. And you lose all bits. That’s the worst part is you lose everything because you can’t carry everything with you.”
“People think you want to be on the streets or you’re begging for money and you’re going home to, I don’t know, a Ferrari and a five-bedroom house, but you’re not. You don’t want to be asking, sometimes you just put your head down thinking “If I don’t see you, then you’re not going to see me.”
“None of us pick up drugs or drink thinking, “I’m going to get addicted to this.” I didn’t ever think I was going to get addicted. And I didn’t want to be on the streets. It’s embarrassing when people look at you, you don’t want to be there.”
“Sometimes you can forgethowto live in society, if that makes sense, when you live so long doing things a different way”
The future
“Hopefully I will get back to work. If you’re sat around all day then you will fall back into the wrong side of life. But if I keep with my courses, keep busy and then hopefully the next step will be getting back on my own. I don’t want to go back to that life of sofa surfing, losing all my stuff, I’ve got stuff back again now, clothes back again, I’ve got a room and a fridge. It’s just things like that, you forget not being able to go to the fridge and get your stuff out, because normally somebody would have eaten your food and it’s just having a fridge that you can go and get something out of it that you want. It’s just things like that that you take for granted.”
“Without Homeless Oxfordshire I think I’d still be using. I wouldn’t be as far forward as I am, like attending my courses, trying to make myself better, pay my TV license and stuff like that. Yeah. I wouldn’t feel stronger enough to say, “No,” And I do feel now that I can.”

Concerned about someone?
“I first went into rehab in June 2015, because I’man alcoholic. I was fired three times from the same job, because they wanted me back, but they didn’t want me in the kind of state I was in, I suffer from mental health illnesses and eating disorders. So it was all a very mixed bag, really, in terms of ways work could support me.
As much as my family could support me, you get to a point in time where everyone really has to take a step back because there’s only so much support they can give. And it’s kind of a sense of tough love, andyou can’t really support someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. No one could really support me anymore, but I knew my sister was here and there’s a good support network, so I felt safer here than I did anywhere else.
I always knew I had a problem. From age 18, I always knew, but I didn’t think that I’d ever end up sleeping in a doorway. I didn’t really want to live anymore at all.I kind of just gave up on myself. I ended up sleeping behind the Magistrates court. I just didn’t really feel anything. I’d kind of just shut myself off completely from everyone and everything and I’d just given up. I just didn’t care. I had a rash on my face from being outside.
When I came to Homeless Oxfordshire I was appointed a key worker, who at the time was Dee, and she was absolutely fantastic. And she just made me feel like a person again. I suppose when you’ve just lost all hope, it’s so important just to have someone just to listen.
There’s just such support here. It’s just incredible and that’s from the key worker to the guys on reception. The night staff even, because I’m a bit of a worrier, I’ll panic at the strangest of time. So even on setup up, I’d get up at three o’clock in the morning with something in my head, and I’d come out and be like, “Oh, I’m panicking.” And they’d just have a chat, just a normal chat.And it’s so vital when you’re in that position and you just don’t care anymore, just to have someone to talk to. I can only blame myself for where I am and what I’ve done, and who I’ve let down. So just to sit down with my key worker and be reminded that, actually you are still a person and you should have hope. And she kind of instilled that in me.
I can’t put it into words really.It’s such a just incredible place full of such staff who are… don’t make me cry now. They’re just so understanding and supportive.
And I don’t think Oxford could really run without them. I know they couldn’t because you couldn’t find this kind of team anywhere else. They’ve got such passion for people, that you couldn’t beatthem at all.
Where I am at the moment? A positive place.
They opened doors for people, they really do. And they make things achievable and possible, and they point you in the right direction, and they’ve never left me just to my own devices, as it were. Not that I’m not capable, or well hopefully one day I will, but you know, I always know that I can come back even when I’m not living here, just to be reassured that I’m still a proper person inside.
And now I find myself in a fantastic house through Homeless Oxfordshire. And with all the support to help me move forward.
So to be homeless you just need somewhere like Homeless Oxfordshire to give you that support and give you that hope, because I know it’s cheesy, but hope, means pain ends. And it’s that that this place gives.
Support Homeless Oxfordshire as much as possible, because they keep people alive.”

Concerned about someone?
After her flat was taken over by a new landlord, Penny* couldn’t afford the increased rent. Struggling with her mental health after a divorce, Penny became homeless and started living on the streets. Since sharing her story, Penny has moved on to independent living.
“I’ve worked all my life and I’ve managed to live a fairly good life. I had my own flat and at one point I was married; I was doing all right. Then I became divorced and my mental health deteriorated.  I started struggling with life in general. I used all my savings for the divorce – that’s the tough thing. Divorce is very difficult. And because of my illness and the medication I started taking then, I found I could not work full-time. Whereas I used to work 2-3 jobs at a time, I had to reduce my hours to 30 a week.
I was still managing [to pay the rent] but my landlord died and somebody else took over the property. They said we were not paying market rate rent – which we weren’t because my landlord was very generous; he realised how bad the [housing] situation was for normal people. The new landlord increased the rent by £200 but my wages only went up by 20p an hour, so I could not afford to live in that property anymore. I became a lodger for a year and a half and then the lady wanted to sell the house. She only gave me two weeks to leave and I couldn’t find anywhere suitable or that I could afford to rent privately – so I became homeless.”
“I was sleeping rough outside Oxford train station for two weeks. Someone from Outreach [St Mungo’s] came to where I was sleeping and they took my details and then they told me about coming here [O’Hanlon House]. I’ve never been homeless before. Well not for a long time, I was sofa surfing when I was a teenager but that’s different. But to actually sleep on a pavement, this was my first time sleeping rough.
I came to O’Hanlon House when I was a Day Service user. And when I came here for the first time I was able to have a meal; an actual meal, I couldn’t believe it. I hadn’t been eating properly and I’d been depending on people giving me sandwiches and a bit of food. It was the first time I was actually able to eat a meal on a plate, with a knife and fork; I couldn’t believe it. I had some fruit, smoothies – it was brilliant. I could have a shower and I was able to wash my clothes. There’s computers as well, so I could go online and check my emails and connect with people that knew about me being homeless but who I hadn’t been able to connect with.”
“Then I was able to get a place on Sit Up, so I could actually sleep inside instead of sleeping outdoors. Sit Up is where they [Homeless Oxfordshire] don’t have beds because they’re full but they allow you to come in anyway and sleep on the floor or in a chair in one of the common rooms. So it’s not a bed but it’s so much better than being outside and safer as well – so it’s so much better than sleeping on a pavement. Even though you’re still sleeping on the floor, you get a duvet, you get pillows, so it was still so much better than a pavement for sure. And that was really, really good. Even just to sit down and watch the television, you know, a small thing like that. The World Cup was on as well so I was able to catch up on the matches.
I didn’t know this place existed until I was told about it, so if I was trying to make it on my own I don’t think I would have survived long on the streets. I now have a room here and it’s been good, steady good. I have had difficulties with my mental health and I had a relapse – that was quite bad. So around that time, when my mental health wasn’t good, I found it slightly difficult to interact with staff. But I think the staff are brilliant; they do a really good job and have been really helpful. Every time I need something they do their utmost to help. And when I was quite ill they kept checking on me and those little checks, they might not mean much to others, but to me it was really good knowing that someone is thinking about you.  They would come to my room and check if I’d had a meal; if I hadn’t eaten then they’d check if I’d at least had a drink and that was really, really amazing actually. They’ve been very good.”
“Things are progressing quite well now. The staff have helped me with things like benefits; there’sa lotof paperwork, appointments, assessments. They’ve helped with basic things I just would not have been able to do by myself; like filling in a lot of online forms as well. And now I’m in a place where I’m getting all the help that I’m entitled to – I’m waiting to move on to a flat in the next 3-4 weeks, so I’m really pleased about that. Moving on to a flat also might just get me my life back.
I’ve had to put my job on hold for a while as I’m trying to settle down, so I’m looking forward to going back to work because it helps with my mental health as well. And, you know, things that become very difficult when you become homeless, they seem almost impossible and the staff here have been brilliant in helping me tackle them step by step; one thing at a time. I’m in a good place now, I’m feeling hopeful again that life might get better.
There is a lot of stigma attached to being homeless and someone might feel they don’t want anyone to know, but that’s the worst thing; because if nobody knows then nobody can help you.  So just tell someone. Tell the people who have been doing this for a long time – they know what they’re doing.
Anyone could become homeless. My friends, when they realised I’d become homeless, were very supportive and a lot of them said ‘You know, most people are only a wage cheque away from being homeless’. And that is the reality today.”
Will you support someone like Penny on their journey out of homelessness?

Story 18
Source: https://homelessoxfordshire.uk/2018/10/10/life-finally-feels-good/

Concerned about someone?
“I’ve been homeless twice in my life. The first time I was just 14. Myself and my siblings lived with our mum in one bedroom in a hostel after escaping our violent dad. I felt it was my job to protect my brothers and sisters and to provide a safe, stable future for them all; I had to make a decision early on whether I was going to survive or not. So I tried hard at school and I was the first person in my family to go to university. I trained to be a teacher.
In my early 20’s I began to fall into bouts of manic depression. But eventually, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Over time, my partner became abusive. He was controlling and violent. I became emotionally unstable and eventually, I had a breakdown.”
“For the next 20 years, I carried on living in an abusive relationship whilst battling with my disorder. I turned to drugs and alcohol for relief. But I became more and more dependent on the quick fixes. My addiction led to recurring bouts of psychosis and I felt completely hopeless and could not see a way out.
I felt like I was on a constant treadmill, not being able to get off, but I realised I had to make a choice; either leave my relationship and recover, or stay and sink further into the cycle. It wasn’t easy to believe I could live life without drugs or alcohol. They were the solutions to numb the emotional and physical pain I felt.
However, I found a drug and alcohol recovery service and completed the 12-step sobriety course. At last, I felt I had found a way to get out of the cycle of addiction and looked forward to getting my life back on track. Once sober, I realised I needed to get out of my relationship before it was too late. I’m not sure how I found the strength but I left. I started sofa-surfing around my friend’s houses but my partner followed me and threatened my friends so I began sleeping in my car.”
“I came to Homeless Oxfordshire and went straight into Community Housing. I was given a place in sober living accommodation to keep me on track. Dependence is the hardest thing to talk about and it’s even harder to ask for help. As an intelligent, educated and articulate woman, I felt that I should have been able to deal with my situation. I was so grateful to have the one-to-one support of my key worker – it gave me consistency and helped build trust in my relationships with people.
Homeless Oxfordshire gave me a space to recover after all I’d been through, and my key worker supported me to get back into employment. I have now been sober for 18 months. I am working again as a teacher and am dating someone who treats me as an equal. Life finally feels good.
Homelessness is something that society views as self-inflicted, which is simply not the case. I, as a professional, middle-class woman, would never have dreamed I’d become homeless again. But I did. Homelessness is an uncomfortable subject because it reminds us all that our lives are finely balanced. It only takes one or two circumstances for us to find ourselves without a home.”
Support people like Emma out of homelessness. Just £5 a month could help someone transform their life.

Concerned about someone?
I’ve always been getting in to trouble unfortunately, been getting in and out of prison since I was 15. I’d go to prison, then when I’d get out I’d stay with family, or sofa surf round friends flats. I’m 39 now, so this pattern has been going on for years.
I was married, and I lived with my wife for a while. Sadly, that all came to end when whilst I was in prison she began using drugs again, so once I was released I also relapsed. Through crime, we lost our house, and the kids were taken away from us.
My mum didn’t want me to be anywhere near her house because of all the crime and drugs. My family and friends were done with me, and my wife was in prison, so I found myself on the streets.
Luckily, the outreach team found and verified me and I managed to get a place here at O’Hanlon house just before Christmas. Some people look down on the shelter and hostels, but for me this place has calmed me down and has given me stability.
I’ve had problems with depression and anxiety for a long time. Finding myself on the streets just absolutely destroyed me.
I’d been doing it for a few days, but it all suddenly dawned on me what I was doing: homeless, on the streets, in a sleeping bag, with a drug problem, begging.
It absolutely broke me and I was sat there just in tears, sobbing my heart out. I didn’t know what do. That was rock bottom for me and it made me think ‘do you know what, I’m changing this’.
It’s been an absolute Godsend. Before I came to here, my life was in complete chaos. It was only a matter of time before I would have ended up back in prison, or dead.
Coming to O’Hanlon house and getting a room here is just calmed me down so much. I’ve managed to get a methadone prescription, I’ve got somewhere stable to live, I’m not spending my benefit payments on drugs and I’ve focused on making my room look nice.
I just keep myself to myself really, then I go out and go to my support groups. The staff here have been really encouraging. Sometimes it’s just the little confidence boost that they give me, letting me know I’m doing better and actually seeing that I’m really trying and that they are believing in me.
I probably would have looked down on homeless people before all this if I’m honest. I grew up on the estate, and have always been an estate lad so would probably would have always looked down on someone who was begging and stuff like that.
I would have thought that I was better than them. But now, I see that anyone can end up in that situation. I wouldn’t have thought a few years before all this that I would have ended up begging on the streets and rough sleeping. It’s all really changed my opinion on it.
I’m taking things quite slow. I’ve got move on options, and me and my project worker Glen have been discussing maybe moving to a project 41 shared house.
I’m trying to sort out my benefits situation at the moment, my health and also paying off some rent arrears I’ve accumulated over the years. I would like my own place one day, though I know I’m not going to get my own place straight away, and that it’s a process of moving through the different steps.
I also want to be able to be in a position to focus on getting back into honest work again soon, so I can earn money and meet new people. I’d also like to volunteer.
People I’ve seen in town have asked me where I am now, and how they can get in O’Hanlon house too. So I’ve explained the process to them and hope they can get help too.
I’ve told them that the foods nice, the people are nice, and it’s just what you make of it. If you want to sit around on the streets getting drunk and taking drugs, than that’s up to you isn’t it? But there’s so much help available down here that I just tell people to come and take advantage of it and to sort their lives out.
I think some people are surprised to be honest. When I first got in to O’Hanlon house I said to people “Watch how I change now, I’m gonna start sorting stuff out.” And you they just said “Oh yeah yeah whatever”.
And I have actually done that, I am sorting my stuff out, and people are quite surprised. I hope that it might inspire them a bit, because If I can do it, anyone can.
