Tarek's Story
Tarek* was referred to Step by Step as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child. As a teenager back in Syria, he did construction work to support his mum and younger siblings after his dad had been wrongfully imprisoned by government forces. Due to the increasing threat of death from these government forces, Tarek was forced to leave his home country, leaving behind his family and the only life he ever knew.
The 17 year old took on a perilous journey, travelling through many different countries where he faced violence and torture, before arriving safely in the UK. When Tarek arrived, he was relieved to finally feel safe but also devastated that he had to separate from his mum and younger sisters to do so.
After arriving in the UK, he was referred to Step by Step’s Supported Lodgings service via the National Transfer Scheme. Tarek was soon matched with a host family in Reading, who have helped him to feel safe and secure during uncertain times.
His hosts have supported him to open a bank account, attend health appointments and to join a local mosque. They’ve taught him how to cook, help him with his homework and are always there for him when he’s homesick or unsure.
Initially Tarek only knew a few words in English, but as a committed learner he is now able to hold full conversations in English. He is on track to complete his ESOL level 2 qualification by the summer and dreams of becoming an engineer.
When dictator Bashar al-Assad finally fled Syria, Tarek had some hope that his dad may be found in one of the prisons. Sadly, after footage was released of the mass graves used to bury prisoners, he has lost that hope. He now believes his father was one of the hundreds of thousands of people murdered whilst in wrongful imprisonment.
Despite everything Tarek has been through, he remains a positive person. He is kind and polite to all and has found a group of good friends who he plays sports with and meets with at the mosque regularly.
Now that he has obtained right to remain status, he is keen to take on a mechanics course at Reading College. Tarek is extremely thankful that the UK have granted him asylum and is passionate about giving back to the country that’s welcomed him. He hopes to one day move closer to his uncle in London and is determined to make a success of his life.

Sally's Story
Sally* became homeless at just 17 years old. When she thought she had nowhere else to go, there was a new family waiting to offer her safety and support.
Following a breakdown in her relationship with her parents, Sally moved in with her brother, sleeping on the sofa in his one-bedroom flat. However, this would jeopardize his tenancy and so Sally had to move on.
That’s where Step by Step was able to help. We assessed Sally to see which model of accommodation would best meet her needs. She had a history of poor mental health and needed a safe home and a supportive adult to help develop her skills and learn to live independently.
Step by Step’s Supported Lodgings service was the ideal solution. Its network of 250 placements spanning six counties, meant we could offer Sally a place with a host family within commuting distance of her college.
Sally moved into her new home within a week of her initial assessment. Her hosts made her feel safe and welcome, and they immediately got on well. Sally felt she could confide in her new mentors and talk about her life and aspirations.
One of the key benefits of Supported Lodgings is that it allows a young person to live in a family environment, with mentors they can learn from. That was very much the case for Sally. Her hosts helped her find a routine, taught her how to make healthy meals on a budget, and encouraged her to seek support from a GP for her mental health issues.
The hosts added Sally’s appointments to the family planner, showing her that she was considered as much a part of the family as their own children.
Sally has progressed immeasurably since moving into Supported Lodgings. She is doing well at college and wants study Bio-Medics at University. She is taking driving lessons and has found a part-time job that fits around her studies. For the first time, she is feeling confident about her future.
But perhaps most importantly of all, Sally now has somewhere she feels she belongs.

003 - Callum's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/callums-story/

Callum's Story
Callum* was forced to leave the family home when his relationship with his stepfather broke down. Like 190,000 young people in the UK each year, Callum found himself homeless. He was lost and confused, and didn’t know where to turn.
Callum was fortunate enough to find the support he needed, something that is sadly not true of most young people experiencing homelessness. After an initial assessment to understand his needs, Step by Step offered him a place in our Aldershot accommodation.
When he first arrived, Callum suffered from crippling social anxiety and night terrors, and as a result initially kept to himself. However, he was able to engage well with his Support Worker and the help he was offered.
Step by Step places a great deal of emphasis on tailored support that helps young people grow in confidence and work towards their goals. During his weekly support sessions, Callum’s Support Worker encouraged him to speak to a GP about possible solutions to his anxiety and engage in talking therapies. He also received a diagnosis for his condition and was prescribed the medication he needed.
Callum started to demonstrate positive progress. He was able to live in a Step by Step Supported Independence Flat. This is accommodation where he would live more independently, learning life skills while still having access to specialist support. Callum also received help from Step by Step’s Wellbeing service, where a specialist Support Worker provided ongoing, tailored support for his anxiety and social issues.
Everyone who worked with Callum was delighted at the progress he made. Nine months later, he moved into private rental accommodation, able to enjoy the independence that seemed so far out of reach when he first came to Step by Step.
Callum’s journey from homelessness and anxiety to independence is a testament to the holistic approach Step by Step takes when supporting young people.

004 - Bradley's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/bradleys-story/

Bradley's Story
Bradley* was made homeless at just 16 years old. Fortunately, Step by Step was able to offer him a place in Supported Lodgings, living with a host family who would provide the safety and guidance he needed.
Bradley responded well to the support, passing his college courses while finding a part-time job. He was in placement for two years and thrived in a caring environment.
However, when Bradley turned 18, he was no longer eligible for the statutory funding that covered his Supported Lodgings placement. He would have to find alternative accommodation within 56 days.
His Step by Step Support Worker helped Bradley look for somewhere suitable to move on to. It is very challenging for young people in his position to find potential rooms – not only are rents historically expensive, but there is huge competition for places and most get snapped up within hours of coming onto the market.
Bradley was using a popular website to look for rentals in shared houses. Unfortunately, his free membership of the site only allowed him access to places that had already been listed for seven days. This meant that by the time he was able to contact potential landlords, the places had already gone.
This is where Step by Step’s Opportunity Fund came in. This is a fund that can be used for ad hoc purchases and payments to help young people overcome the barriers they face. It could pay for a bike to get to college or a laptop to study online, for example.
In Bradley’s case, his Support Worker used the Opportunities Fund to pay the £30 membership fee for the property website. While this is a small amount of money for most people, it was unaffordable for Bradley and the funding made all the difference.
Bradley was able to apply for accommodation as soon as it became available. It wasn’t long before he secured a room in a shared house that was the ideal location and affordable. Without the Opportunities Fund paying for his site membership, the room would not even have been an option.
Bradley told us: “The funding helped me look for rooms more efficiently as more came up and I had the option before some others.”
Bradley is now living independently and doing well. The Opportunities Fund helped him overcome a barrier that for many would seem trivial, but for Bradley would have prevented him moving on with his life.

Jenny's Story
Jenny* was forced to leave the family home at just 17 years old. Things had become increasingly difficult to the point she no longer felt safe.
Step by Step were able to help at what was a very scary, anxious time for her. We offered Jenny a place in Supported Lodgings, living with a host family who would provide not only a safe place to live, but the nurturing and mentorship she needed to move forward with her life.
Jenny’s hosts were supportive from day one, offering her a space to talk about anything that was on her mind. The hosts already had two children of their own, and they allowed Jenny to integrate with their family to the point she felt comfortable and cared for.
Soon after settling into her placement, Jenny found herself a job. Her Support Worker says: “Jenny gives her work her all. Some days are very tough due to the nature of the role, but she knows she has somewhere comforting to come home to and somewhere she can rest at the weekends.”
All was going well with the placement. However, Jenny would have to move out on her 18th birthday, because placements are not statutorily funded post-18. Jenny was working towards university, and leaving Supported Lodgings at this time would have jeopardised her studies; she would have to move out of a stable living arrangement at precisely the wrong time.
Fortunately, Step by Step is able to offer Extended Supported Lodgings placements in such situations. These placements are not reliant on statutory funding and so can support young people beyond 18 years old.
This meant that Jenny could continue her studies and stay with her host family right up until her university start date.
Thanks to her Extended Supported Lodgings placement, Jenny had the time and space to prepare for the next chapter in her life.

Luke's Story
Twenty-one year old Luke* had been sleeping in a tent in a park for several months. Despite living in appalling circumstances and having no income, he did not meet the local council’s definition of priority need. He was desperate and had nowhere to turn.
Fortunately, Luke found the details of Step by Step when he was searching for help online and our Launch service was able to support him. We gave him access to a shower and food parcels, while his Support Worker helped him to claim Universal Credit.
With his short-term needs met, the next priority was to find Luke somewhere safe and stable to live. His Support Worker helped him look for rooms in shared houses, but it soon transpired that he didn’t have the life skills and confidence to live independently. He would need support to learn how to cook, manage his income and maintain a tenancy.
As well as supporting young people directly, Step by Step has relationships with partner organisations that young people can be referred to. We didn’t have an immediate place for Luke, so his Support Worker negotiated a place for him with the Amber Foundation - a charity supporting young people with a high level of need.
Eight days after presenting to Step by Step as homeless, Luke had a stable environment to work on developing life skills and progressing into independence.
We are delighted to report that Luke is now attending University, living in halls and thriving in his new life. His Step by Step Support Worker will always remember the young man who came to us when living in a tent and who now has a bright future ahead of him.

Sophie's Story
Sophie* was desperate to leave her previous neglectful living situation. She and the person who was supposed to be caring for her rarely spent time with each other, and she felt that they simply did not care about her at all.
After years of feeling as though she didn’t belong, Sophie was at an incredibly low point in her life before she reached out to Step by Step for help.
Once Sophie got in contact with us, we were able to find her a Supported Lodgings placement with a nurturing and supportive host family who welcomed her into their home with open arms.
Sophie now sees herself as part of her host family and knows that they genuinely care about her.
She’s been really enjoying cooking with her host and being included in family dinners, something she says would never have happened where she was living previously. Even a simple “Hello. How was your day?” from her host family makes her feel as though she belongs.
Sophie is now thriving in her current Supported Lodgings placement. She has managed to maintain her job at a local sandwich shop and is currently on the hunt for more financially stable work as she’s saving up to fund her own car and insurance.
She’s become more independent in dealing with a medical condition she has and now feels empowered to be able to take control of her appointments - although she knows the support is there when she needs it.
When talking about her current placement, Sophie told Step by Step: “I feel like I belong here and can be myself. Everyone is so lovely to me, and it’s a place that I can call home.”

Hassan's Story
Hassan* came to Step by Step’s New Forest Foyer in February 2023, having arrived in the UK from Iran just a few weeks earlier. He was a very polite young man despite feeling lost, overwhelmed and apprehensive in this new country and situation.
When Hassan arrived, he told us that he was very keen to be moved further along the coast nearer to one of his brothers. Unfortunately, social worker teams had promised him that this would be possible when sadly it simply was not.
Hassan’s support team at Step by Step quickly built a great relationship with him, based on truth and trust, and were able to help him understand why the move was not possible. Step by Step advocated for him to be able to rebuild and maintain relationships, and eventually he was granted permission from children’s services to stay overnight with his brothers.
Hassan was also eager to start his education, but again this proved hard to arrange due to local colleges being oversubscribed. The Step by Step team did what they could to provide Hassan with basic learning, until a successful application to Eastleigh College saw him start full-time education in September. He has remained committed to his learning, has perfect attendance and is attaining high grades.
As he approaches 18, and having recently had asylum status granted, Hassan has discovered how much the local area has to offer in the way of further education, job opportunities, and places to live. He has also built an incredibly supportive community around himself, becoming a valued member of the local church he regularly attends.
Hassan also greatly appreciates that he can easily visit his brothers from where he is, so has decided to continue his education locally and to build on the settled life he is carving for himself in the New Forest.
His support team are confident that Hassan will have no problem transitioning to a lower support service soon. Since he came to Step by Step, Hassan has shown resilience and perseverance in everything he does.

Rachel* became homeless following a severe relationship breakdown with her mum. She had been living with her boyfriend’s family, but they were no longer able to support her and she had to leave.
Step by Step was able to offer her a place in our Havant Foyer. This would provide not only a safe place to live, but tailored support for the other challenges she faced.
Upon moving in, Rachel’s Support Worker identified that she experienced high levels of anxiety and suffered from poor mental health. Rachel was prone to angry outbursts as a result. Together, they worked to address these issues, coming up with an action plan to empower Rachel to help herself.
Rachel had always enjoyed baking, and at Christmas cooked dinner for the residents and staff at the Foyer. She decided she wanted to pursue a career in the food industry, and her Support Worker helped her enrol on a catering course at college. She soon proved herself a fantastic student – her tutors are pleased with her progress and she has shown real determination to do well.
With help from her Support Worker, Rachel has managed to reduce her anxiety and learned how to control situations that might have previously been a challenge. She has a positive relationship with staff and peers at Step by Step.
Rachel has also established a support network of friends who she enjoys spending time with, something she had always wanted to achieve but which her anxiety had prevented.
We are all incredibly proud of Rachel and everything she has achieved so far

Nick's Story
Nick* came to Step by Step after his relationship with his dad broke down and he became homeless. Until then, Nick had been the main carer for his non-verbal, autistic older brother. Sadly, Nick was experiencing significant neglect which only worsened after his stepmother left the family home.
Once homeless, Nick began sleeping rough in carparks, and sofa surfing at his girlfriend’s family home whenever possible.
Eventually Nick contacted Step by Step and we were able to find him a Supported Lodgings placement which provided him with a stable and supportive place to live.
After just a few short weeks Nick has now built a wonderful relationship with his Step by Step supported lodgings host. He’s also been able to attend college again thanks to a 3-month bus pass he’s been awarded from our Opportunities fund.
Nick’s host says “Nick is engaging well and is very appreciative of the support. He often helps with the dogs, and he is a very kind, thoughtful young man.”
Nick is now learning independent living skills including maintaining his personal care and eating healthy meals. He has also been able to receive benefits, has his own bank account, and is budgeting successful.
An excellent gamer, Nick aspires to become a game developer one day. Previously he was invited to a gaming tournament in the US to play as part of a team, and he believes they could have been in with a chance of winning. Unfortunately his parents were not supportive of his passion.
Nick has been getting on well with the other young people at his supported lodgings and has become great friends with a fellow gamer.
Nick says “I feel safe and settled here. I am happy and pleased to be furthering my education.”

Skye's Story
Skye* became homeless after leaving her mum’s house to escape emotional abuse.
Due to poor mental and emotional health, Skye was considered too high need for some supported accommodation providers. She was referred to Step by Step and after an initial assessment, was given a Supported Accommodation Bed. This placement would ensure she had the one-to-one support she required to address her self-harm, anxiety attacks and other challenges.
Skye engaged really well with the Support Worker and other Step by Step staff. We identified the priority areas of need to be her mental health and her self-care skills.
It was not long before Skye began to progress positively. She accessed mental health support from Step by Step and from her GP, leading to an increase in confidence and a reduction in self-harm. She also developed new independent living skills, learning to cook healthy meals and take care of her cleanliness.
The future is now looking so much brighter for Skye. She has found a part-time job that she really enjoys and has learned to manage her finances for herself.
Skye is now on the waiting list for a place in our Supported Independence Flats – the final step before moving on to independent living.
We are delighted to see how far she has progressed in the face of such adversity.

012 - Dylan's Story

Dylan's Story
Dylan* approached our Launch advice and guidance service when he became homeless and needed help to find accommodation. Dylan has no family support, is on the Autistic Spectrum, and struggles with communication and understanding what is expected of him.
The Launch Support Worker helped Dylan find accommodation in an independent living village for the disabled. Launch continued to provide him with ongoing tenancy support, to help him understand the terms of his agreement, and ensure the placement remained positive for him.
Personal Independence Payments (PIP) are a benefit intended to help with extra living costs for those with long-term physical or mental health disabilities. We felt that Dylan very much qualified for this payment and helped him to apply.
Unfortunately, Dylan’s application for PIP was rejected twice following telephone assessments. We thought this was unfair and appealed. Dylan was struggling to afford to pay for daily essentials and was having to use food banks.
Dylan’s PIP claim was taken to a tribunal. The Launch Support Worker helped Dylan to present his case, gathering over 100 pieces of evidence of his disability to support his claim. The Support Worker attended the hearing as Dylan’s advocate, helping him to understand what was going on, as well as providing professional insight to the judge.
The judge agreed that Dylan was in fact eligible for disability support payments. Dylan was awarded a £10,000 back payment to cover the two years he had been without any financial support.
Dylan will turn 25 soon, at which point he will no longer be able to access Launch. The PIP payments will mean he is able to employ a personal assistant, allowing him a future of dignified, independent living.

Charlie's Story
Charlie* reached out to Launch when suddenly faced with homelessness. Following a relationship breakdown with his friend’s parents, he was asked to leave their home in less than two months.
Alongside a Launch support worker, Charlie looked at all his available options and realised he would need a job to support himself whilst finding a new home. Together they decided that a lodger placement would be the best option for him and began preparing for a job interview so Charlie could move forward with his life.
Though it may have felt difficult at times, soon, Charlie was successful at securing a new job. Quickly after that triumph, with the ongoing help from Launch, Charlie was also able to find a place to stay. He could finally feel the weight of possibly being homeless lifting off his shoulders. Launch paid the deposit for the home allowing Charlie to get settled and feel hopeful about his future.
Two weeks later, Charlie moved into his new home, started his new job and could look back on the prospect of homelessness as a thing of the past.
When Charlie contacted Launch, homelessness had been just two months away. Just one month later, he would start to feel secure and stable once more. He has been able to grow independently, knowing he had Launch’s continued support behind him.

Kaitlin's Story
Kaitlin* became homeless at 18 years old following a family breakdown. She suffered from poor mental health as a result of experiencing a hostile home life and lacked confidence.
Step by Step was able to offer Kaitlin a Supported Lodgings placement. She was matched with a host with whom she has a lot in common, in a very quiet, calming home.
It was just what Kaitlin needed. She felt comfortable and relaxed in her new home and it started to have a positive impact on her mental health. She grew in confidence and began to go out and make friends, while also finding a part time job that fitted in with college. Her life became more like that of a typical 18 year old.
Kaitlin was due to move out of the placement after 6 months; Supported Lodgings placements are typically not funded after 18 years old. However, it was a critical point in Kaitlin’s education. She was revising for upcoming exams and looking for university places. This could have been jeopardised had she been burdened with the additional stress of finding a private rental and living independently.
Fortunately, thanks to funding from supporters, Supported Lodgings can now offer extended places beyond the age of 18. This has enabled Kaitlin to have the best possible chance of doing well in her A Levels. She is looking forward to going to university and excited about where her future might take her.
Kaitlin told us: “I can’t express how grateful I am to be able to stay here while I finish my exams and go to Uni. I really don’t know where I would have been without this help. I couldn’t have coped with doing my exams while having nowhere to live, so thank you so much.”

Mike found himself homeless on Christmas Eve at just 19 years old. There would have been very few options available to him if not for Step by Step's Supported Independence Flats. He went from homeless to housed in just one hour.

015 - Lacey's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/laceys-story/

Lacey's Story
Lacey* came to Step by Step after both her parents passed away. Devastated and alone, Lacey needed a stable place to live as well as a great deal of compassion and support.
Lacey was initially given a place in one of our Foyers, living alongside other young people her age. However, she preferred the idea of a family environment and it was decided that our Supported Lodgings service would be the perfect fit.
At first, she was very nervous about living with her host, but after a few meetings to discuss her concerns, she felt ready to move in.
Lacey and her host went on to develop a fantastic relationship, characterised by honesty and openness. The trauma of losing her parents had left Lacey with mental health issues; the host would recognise when she was struggling, not sleeping or eating very much and offer her support.
With such a safe, caring environment to live in, Lacey soon began to thrive. She did well at college and was accepted into drama school. She decided that she wanted to continue living with her host for the first year of studying, until she feels she is ready to move on to independent living.
Lacey got herself a part time job, enjoying the new responsibility and having her own money for the first time. She has aspirations for a career on the stage and also wants to go travelling to experience different cultures.
Lacey has now joined our Young Person’s Advisory Group. This is a focus group comprised of young people, many of whom have accessed our services. They feed back on changes and improvements that they feel would benefit their peers. Lacey wants to take on the role of lead ambassador and we know she will bring great energy and insight to the position.
Despite suffering significant bereavement at a very young age, Lacey has displayed incredible resilience and maintains a positive outlook on life. Step by Step will continue to support her until she is ready to move on.
When asked what she thought about living with her host, Lacey told us: “I like that things are consistent and normal. This feels like home.”

016 - Lena's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/lenas-story/

Lena's Story
Lena* became homeless at just 16 years old. Her parents were separated and due to a combination of mental health and financial issues were not able to support her. Her mum had paid the rent on a flat for Lena, but after losing her income due to COVID, could no longer afford to pay for this. Lena was forced to leave and found herself without a home at a vulnerable age.
Lena was a keen and proficient student. She was studying Biology, Criminology and Sociology, and was expected to get A or B grades. However, she was not able to attend college without money and a stable to place to live.
Fortunately, Step by Step were able to help her. Lena was given a place in our Supported Lodgings service living with a host family. A Support Worker was on hand to assess Lena’s needs and together they formulated a plan to help her meet her goals.
With support from the host and Step by Step team, Lena applied for Universal Credit and got a college bursary so that she could continue the studies that meant so much to her.
Lena lacked confidence and was very shy, and initially spent a lot of time in her room. But her host was patient and understanding, and they soon developed a good relationship. When Lena had some health issues, the host and Support Worker acted in place of parents in taking her for hospital appointments and supporting her through an operation.
This is a fantastic example of how Supported Lodgings is more than just a roof over a head; young people are supported as though part of a caring family, with a focus on setting goals and reaching their full potential.
Lena did very well in her college exams and was offered a scholarship for university. She is now enjoying her studies and lives independently with a bright future ahead of her.
In Lena’s own words: “I am excited and scared about the future, but feel more confident to deal with it.”

Will's Story
Will* became homeless after escaping from an abusive partner. He approached Step by Step and after assessing his needs, we were able to give him a place in our Supported Independence Flats. This accommodation would allow him to live largely independently, but with support available to help him achieve his goals.
Will was keen to get into employment, so his Support Worker helped him apply for jobs and become work ready. Support sessions also focused on learning key life skills, including managing his finances. He also received support with his mental health and confidence.
Will responded well to the help offered to him and was motivated in working towards his Support Plan. He enrolled with a GP to seek help for his mental health issues and began to take steps towards self-sufficiency.
In Step by Step’s Supported Independence Flats, young people live with two or three of their peers and are responsible for their own washing, cleaning and other chores. They are also expected to pay towards bills if they are in work. This accommodation model is ideal for young people without a high level of need, and is good preparation for independent living.
It was a pleasure to see Will grow closer to achieving his goals. He got his mental health issues under control, increased in confidence and started to apply for private rentals.
Eventually, Will felt ready to move on from Step by Step. He moved into a shared house with friends and now has the skills and confidence to work towards realising his aspirations.

Brayden's Story
Brayden* became homeless after leaving the care system. With nowhere else to turn, he was referred to Step by Step and we offered him Foyer accommodation. Not only was he given a safe place to call home, but he received specialist support to help him move on to a better future.
One of the services that helped Brayden was our Drugs and Alcohol Recovery support.
Brayden was drinking very heavily. He had received several warnings from the Accommodation team and was at risk of being evicted for flouting the zero alcohol policy. He was also getting himself into dangerous situations, waking up in the street and not knowing how he got there, and was at risk of exploitation.
As Brayden got into more of a downward spiral, he quit his job and spent a lot of time in his room. His mental health was being impacted and he wasn’t as outgoing as he had previously been.
Brayden had a course of sessions with Sara, our Recovery specialist. These sessions focus on the reasons why a young person drinks, how to reduce harm, and what they can do instead of drinking. This could be taking up a new interest or re-engaging with an activity they used to enjoy. The sessions also focus on a young person’s self-esteem, resilience and self-forgiveness.
Brayden has since cut down on his drinking and is feeling much better about himself. He is also more motivated, completing a maths course and finding himself a new job.
For the first time, Brayden is taking control of his future. He now has his own place to live, has enrolled at college and aspires to one day go to university.

019 - Shannon's Story

Shannon's Story
Shannon was one of the first beneficiaries of our new Opportunities Fund. This is a pot of money that can be used for ad hoc purchases to help young people with their specific need.
Shannon became homeless when her mum died. She was estranged from her father, and while other family and friends were able to help in the short term, none were able to offer her a permanent, stable place to live.
Step by Step first supported Shannon with our rent deposit scheme. This lent her the funds she needed to move into a shared house.
However, Shannon experienced very poor mental health. This culminated in a serious crisis and she had to give up work as a result.
Eventually, she felt ready to go back into employment, but faced another barrier – she couldn’t afford to go back to work. It would be a month before her first salary payment and in the interim she would have no money for essentials, such as food and travel.
Step by Step supported her once more, this time with the new Opportunities Fund.
Kate Martins, Senior Support Worker for our Launch advice service, remembers taking Shannon’s call. “You could feel it down the phone – the panic, the desperation, not knowing what to do. She had hit rock bottom.”
This is where the Opportunities Fund came in. Step by Step Support Workers can access the fund for any ad hoc purchase they need to directly benefit a young person. In this case, it paid for a supermarket gift card for Shannon to buy groceries, smart clothes for her new job, and a travel card so she could actually get to work.
Shannon had come so far on her journey back to employment – she just needed a bit of additional help to overcome the final hurdle. The Opportunities Fund provided essentials we all take for granted, reinstating Shannon’s dignity and giving her the chance to move on with her life.
James is a trustee for Step by Step, but his involvement with the charity started 10 years ago when he found himself homeless, abandoned by his alcoholic mother. He shares his story and just how he has come so far.

Zoran's Story
“I felt very sad and had no idea where I was.”
Zoran* arrived in the UK as a Kurdish refugee fleeing Iran. He was classed as an Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Child as he had no parent or guardian with him. Alone and frightened, he didn’t even know what country he had arrived in.
“They said I was in England and I should not worry because my life was now safe.”
Zoran had arrived in Dover and stayed in a processing centre for nine days. He was then allocated to West Berks Children’s Services under a re-settlement scheme. Step by Step was able to give him an Emergency Supported Lodgings placement with a host in Reading.
Things immediately felt better for Zoran. He enjoyed having a room of his own and access to nice food. He started to settle in and feel happy. His host Sarah told him that if he needed anything, he just had to ask, and that he could confide in her whenever he felt unhappy.
Zoran bonded well with his host. Sarah taught him English and he now speaks confidently and eloquently. He was made to feel at home and allowed free use of the kitchen.
It turned out that Zoran was a fantastic cook. He enjoyed making meals not just for himself, but for the household. He knew that Sarah would be tired after work and he wanted to help out.
Zoran is enjoying his new life, free from persecution. His ambition is to open his own restaurant and help poorer people and those experiencing homelessness. Having been a recipient of kindness and support himself, he wants to give back to his community.
“My life is safe here,” he told us. “It is like a big dream for me, but one which has come true.”

Amy's Story
Amy* was supported by our Launch advice and information service when she became homeless. The Launch support workers helped her find a safe place to live and assisted her in finding work.
Following a family breakdown, Amy was forced to leave the family home. She moved in with her boyfriend and his mum, but this was a temporary solution. She wanted space of her own but didn’t know where to start or what options were available to her.
Amy contacted Launch and we arranged an appointment to discuss her needs and how we could assist her. We helped her look for rooms to rent with vetted landlords and helped her with budgeting for rent and bills. At the same time, the Launch support workers assisted her in applying for jobs, writing her CV and preparing for interviews.
However, things took a turn for the worse when Amy broke up with her boyfriend and was suddenly without anywhere to live. She needed immediate help with finding safe and stable accommodation.
As well as offering advice and practical support on a range of issues, Launch can refer young people to other Step by Step services. Amy was helped with applying for a place in Foyer accommodation. She moved in just three days later.
With too few places to turn for young people facing homelessness, we were delighted that Launch was able to support Amy at a time she most needed a helping hand.

Josh's Story
When Josh* came to Step by Step, his drug misuse and challenging behaviour hid his true potential. By providing Josh with a stable place to live and working closely with him, he proved himself to be a reliable and hard-working young man with a bright future ahead of him.
Josh became homeless after his long-term foster care placement broke down due to his refusal to stop using cannabis. We assessed him for a place in our Supported Lodgings accommodation and had an open and honest conversation about his drug misuse. It was the start of a good working relationship with Josh.
Through our matching process, we found a Host who would be understanding about Josh’s drug issues and in whom Josh would feel comfortable confiding. The placement got off to a good start, with Josh relaxing into a stable and supportive environment.
However, when Josh was made redundant from his job, he started upon a downward trajectory, becoming involved in very negative peer influence and experimenting with dangerous drugs. Josh’s Step by Step Support Worker signed him up with a local drugs service but he did not really engage. It was only when our Support Worker, with assistance from the Host, offered drugs education and harm reduction advice, that Josh started to take the support onboard.
Josh settled down and found himself a full-time job at a local warehouse. He proved to be a hard-working and reliable employee, despite the unsociable hours doing shift work. His Host supported his transition into adulthood, giving Josh the responsibility for his rent payments and showing him how to complete domestic chores and improve his life skills.
Eventually, Josh felt ready to move on from Supported Lodgings and moved in with his girlfriend at her parent’s house. He is very much part of the family and enjoying life living in the countryside.
What would have become of Josh if his drug issues had not been addressed? What potential would have been wasted?

Layla's Story
Layla* was one of the first beneficiaries of our extended Supported Lodgings service. These are places that receive additional funding in order to extend the duration of the placement and provide support at a critical point in a young person’s journey towards independence.
When Layla was 16, her parents went through a very complex and challenging divorce. Not only did this negatively impact Layla’s mental health, but it also introduced a lot of instability and uncertainty as she was pulled between her parents. Layla’s parents made the decision to put her into care as they were unable to cope with her mental health challenges.
Step by Step initially supported Layla with counselling. She was given new coping strategies to manage her anxiety and depression and to help process her feelings.
Upon leaving care, Layla was accommodated by our Supported Lodgings service. She moved in with a host family who were able to offer a safe and stable home. Layla’s host and support worker helped her to understand and maintain healthy relationships, learn daily life skills and set out an education pathway.
Young people are typically placed in Supported Lodgings
until they are 18 and usually stay for 12 months while they work towards
independent living. However, in some cases, the end of the placement might come
at a critical time for a young person. Our new extended placements are funded
to support young people who would benefit from staying a bit longer.
This was the case with Layla. She was in her final year of her A-levels and due to sit her exams when her placement was to come to an end. We were able to extend the placement until she had completed college.
Layla passed her A-level exams and got a place at University studying Occupational Therapy. She now lives in halls, enjoys her studies and is positive about her future. Without the extension of her Supported Lodgings placement at a key point in her education, the outcome could have been very different.

Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/maddis-story/

Maddi's Story
Maddi* is a brave young woman who was able to turn her life around despite facing numerous challenges.
We first met Maddi when she was given an emergency bed with Step by Step. She had been in numerous foster care placements since the age of 13 following a family breakdown and had never been given the opportunity to settle down. This had resulted in very high levels of anxiety and attachment issues.
Maddi settled into her new placement but she knew it was only temporary and the prospect of having to move again heightened her anxiety further. She was a young person with a high level of need, including a history of self-harm, ADHD, depression and attachment disorder. She desperately needed some stability and a safe, caring place to call home.
We were able to give her that with a Supported Lodgings placement.
Maddi readily accepted the support offered to her. The STEP Worker and host encouraged her to regularly take her medication and engage with the Adult Mental Health Team, which helped to bring her mental health issues under control.
With her newfound stability, Maddi could focus on her future for the first time. She learned new life skills and completed an independent skills workbook.
Maddi has engaged with college once again. She has completed her Maths and English and earned a Distinction in Public Services. Her confidence has grown and she has made huge strides towards a future living independently.

025 - London's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/londons-story/

London's Story
When London* was referred to Step by Step, she was considered a young person with very high needs. She moved into our Foyer accommodation where she could receive dedicated support alongside a stable place to live.
London was very shy at first. She appeared reserved and found communication with other young people and staff a real challenge. The Step Workers adjusted their approach to her needs. They identified the triggers that would lead to London shutting down and becoming resistant to the support provided. They kept the focus on London’s understanding and capacity for processing information, and tailored tasks and expectations to the pace she was comfortable with.
This tailored approach to support started to pay off. London began to engage with her Step Workers, became more pro-active and started to gain a sense of achievement, which encouraged her further.
London’s placement was for six months, but at the end of that term she was not ready to move on to independent living, so her placement was extended for another six months to give her time to prepare.
Gradually, London started to engage more in her support sessions with her key worker. Although there were a few blips and anxious moments where London refused to engage any further, the key worker remained determined and came up with new ideas and encouraging ways to approach London’s anxiety.
London learned key life skills such as basic personal admin, preparing meals by herself, budgeting money, making phone calls, booking appointments and, eventually, contacting landlords to view private rental properties.
London is now living independently in her own flat, an achievement that seemed so far out of reach when she first arrived at Step by Step.

Kaleb's Story
Kaleb* became homeless upon leaving the care system. At just 18 years old, he found himself in the terrifying position of being alone and with nowhere to go.
Step by Step initially offered Kaleb an emergency bed. He was in a bad way at the time and heavily misused cannabis. He was assessed by the accommodation team and it was mutually agreed that our Supported Lodgings service was the best way to meet his needs of a stable home and supportive environment.
When Kaleb first moved into his Host’s home, he was not in education or working. He would sleep all day and not engage with his Host or support worker. However, after gentle perseverance, the support worker had a breakthrough and Kaleb opened up about his issues. He admitted for the first time the extent of his cannabis misuse which dated back several years.
Supported Lodgings not only offered Kaleb a stable place to call home, he also received mentoring, guidance and advice. Over time, this started to have a measurable impact. Kaleb dramatically cut down on smoking cannabis, started to take pride in his cleanliness, wash his own clothes and cook for himself.
Kaleb now works in a scaffolding apprenticeship. He enjoys the role, works hard and gets up at 5am each morning. He has a good relationship with his Host and has a safe and supportive home from which to plan his future.
Kaleb told us: “This is the first place I have lived in six years that I love and care about.”

Harry's Story
Like many young people leaving the care system, Harry* suddenly found himself on his own and with nowhere to go. He was homeless at 19 years old. His experiences in care had left him with mental health issues, PTSD and suicidal thoughts. His future appeared bleak.
Harry was referred to Step by Step’s Supported Lodgings service and was assessed to have a high level of need. He was carefully matched with a compatible Host who would be able to offer the patience and care that Harry required. Supported Lodgings would provide him with a safe place to live and the stability he needed to address the numerous challenges he faced.
When Harry first came to Supported Lodgings, he had no interest in staying in college, was not engaging with mental health support services and was not registered with a GP. He had little motivation and poor eating habits. Fortunately, he could now start receiving the support he needed to address these concerns.
Over time and with lots of persistence from his Host, Harry agreed to enrol with a GP and started to receive combined therapy for his mental health issues. He has since developed a good relationship with his therapist and the sessions are having a positive impact on his outlook.
Harry is engaged with college once more and is eating well. He follows a daily routine that he planned together with his Host.
When asked for his feedback, Harry said he feels at home in his placement and has a clearer picture of his future. He is excited about what it holds for him.

028 - Chloe's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/chloes-story/

Chloe's Story
Chloe* found herself homeless at just 17 years old. She was a victim of domestic abuse and was advised to leave the family home. She had no other family to support her and so temporarily moved in with her partner’s family.
This was not a long-term solution, and she needed somewhere stable to live. Step by Step assessed Chloe for a place in Supported Lodgings and she was placed on the waiting list. However, following an argument with her partner, her partner’s family wanted her to leave immediately.
It was a truly distressing situation for Chloe, having been made homeless twice in short succession. Step by Step responded to her dire circumstances and was able to house her the next day.
When Chloe arrived at the Supported Lodgings service, she had no identification, no bank account and no access to any finances whatsoever. She moved in with her new Host and with support from Step by Step, she registered with a local GP, set up a bank account and made a successful claim for Universal Credit.
Chloe was the first to admit she had hit rock bottom at this point at this point in her life. She felt she had no control or direction, had poor mental health and hated being out of education. Working closely with Chloe and her Host, Step by Step helped her to develop a support plan. This was a series of small goals that would help her move forward and work towards her aspirations.
Chloe is now engaging with a domestic abuse support group and receiving counselling for her mental health issues. She has been accepted at college and will be starting next term. The Host is the key to any successful Supported Lodgings placement and Chloe’s Host has been helping her learn key life skills, including how to cook and how to eat within a budget.
Chloe has come a long way since she first came to us. Now she has one last goal she would like to achieve. When Covid restrictions are lifted, she is looking forward to getting back into playing football and hockey, not just for the physical exercise, but for the chance to make new friends.
She can make these plans only because she has a stable and supportive place to live.

Mike's Story
19-year-old Mike* found himself homeless on Christmas Eve. He had fallen out with his mum and she asked him to leave the family home. He was left with nowhere to go and with no other family nearby to support him.
Mike contacted our Youth AIMS free advice service, presenting himself as street homeless and in need of immediate help. The Youth AIMS team and Foyer staff quickly identified Step by Step’s new Supported Independence Flats as the ideal solution.
Supported Independence Flats is an accommodation service available for young people who would not usually be entitled to statutory support. The aim is to target those young people who would otherwise fall through the gaps in provision. Supported Independence Flats not only provide a safe and stable place to live, but provide support from STEP Workers with a focus on enabling a young person to get into work or education and to move on to independent living.
Mike was assessed by the team and was offered a place within an hour of arriving; he went from homeless to housed in just 60 minutes.
Mike moved into Step by Step on Christmas Eve afternoon. On Christmas morning, he was given a stocking that the Foyer team had made up for him, and joined other young people for Christmas dinner. Mike happily joined in, thanking the staff for working so quickly to help him and for making him feel so welcome.
If not for Step by Step’s Supported Independence Flats, Mike would have had very few options available to him. At best, he would have spent Christmas alone in a B&B or sleeping on a friend’s sofa.

Caroline's Story
Losing your job is tough for anyone. But when you’re a young person living alone and can no longer afford the rent, the impact on your life can be devastating.
That was the situation Caroline* found herself in. After losing her job, she quickly fell into rent arrears. Her mental health issues made things even harder to deal with. Caroline is diagnosed as being on the Autistic Spectrum and has trouble communicating. Her stress and anxiety compounded this and the relationship with her landlord broke down to the point where the landlord wanted her to leave.
Caroline was lost and confused with nowhere else to turn. She approached our Youth AIMS service, which offers advice on housing and other issues, free of charge for any young person. The Youth AIMS team was able to help Caroline by mediating with the landlord to buy her some more time.
Youth AIMS is also able to provide funds to help young people back into work. Caroline found herself a full-time job working night shifts, but due to her period of unemployment, she couldn’t afford the £75 a month train fare to get to her new job. We were able to pay for her transport for the first month, until she received her first salary payment.
“I am really pleased I can start working again,” Caroline said. “I was worrying about how I was going to afford the travel ticket. I don’t need to worry anymore.”
Now that Youth AIMS has helped Caroline back to work, she can afford to find a new private rental and we can give her the support she needs to move on.
Caroline is feeling more confident and hopeful for the future and we are delighted to have helped her get back on track.
Find out more about our Youth AIMS advice servicehere.

Alisha's Story
Alisha*’s world fell apart when her nan died from COVID-19. Not only did she lose someone she loved dearly, but she lost her stability, her mentor and her home.
Alisha had gone to live with her nan at an early age and her nan had brought her up for the last 14 years. Living with her nan was all Alisha knew. When her nan was so cruelly taken away, Alisha found herself lost, confused and homeless.
Our Supported Lodgings accommodation was the ideal fit for Alisha’s needs. We were able to give her a stable home and introduce her to a supportive host – the closest thing she could have to a family living environment.
We identified a host that was the perfect match. They initially met online to discuss what each needed and expected from the placement, and we vetted the host for suitability. Soon Alisha was able to move into her new home.
Alisha struggled at first. Not only was she dealing with grief, but she had to adapt to a new home and the challenges of living in lockdown. Additionally, Alisha had very few life skills as her nan had done everything for her. The host and her STEP Worker were able to support her and encourage her to learn new things. She started to settle in and show signs of coping well.
Alisha has now completed a Prince’s Trust course and is doing online job interviews. She wants to work in care or in a hospital to give something back to society. Fund raised through Step by Step’s COVID-19 Emergency Appeal bought her smart clothes, while her host has helped to build her confidence and prepare for work.
Despite coronavirus taking such an important person in her life, and despite the challenges of living in lockdown, Alisha is looking towards her future with positivity. In just a short time, she has already come so far.

Daniel's Story
Daniel* became homeless when his relationship with his family broke down. He was referred to Step by Step and we gave him an emergency bed as a short-term solution. Daniel was shy and initially quiet, but he was focused and knew what he needed to do to get to where he wanted to be.
Supported Lodgings was the perfect fit for his needs, giving him the support he needed combined with the independence of a family living environment.
Daniel’s STEP Worker matched him with an ideal host family and started the process of moving him in. Unfortunately, the host family had to go into self-isolation when a member of the household developed COVID-19 symptoms.
Just as the STEP Worker was finding a new place for Daniel, lockdown happened.
Young people’s interests are at the heart of everything we do, and lockdown wouldn’t prevent us from supporting Daniel. His STEP Worker organised virtual meetings to place Daniel with the perfect host and he moved in with a family soon after.
Daniel engaged well with his hosts and started to come out of his shell. When he was furloughed from both his jobs – an apprenticeship and a retail position – he stayed positive and made the best of the situation. He completed a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) course to help with his mental health and saved up to buy a motorbike. With help from his hosts, he taught himself to cook and learned lots of recipes.
Daniel turned 18 while in lockdown and was not able to celebrate with his friends.
Daniel is now starting to rebuild his relationship with his family and they are making positive progress. He is looking forward to returning to work, saving some money and embarking on a future of living independently.

James' Story
“My parents divorced when I was four-years-old and I lived with my dad. He was strict but loving, although his partner was incredibly controlling. I felt suffocated, and at 12-years-old, I ran away to live with my mum.
It wasn’t long into living with her that I realised she was an alcoholic. Her new husband also had drinking problems and they would drink a box of wine or two in the evening. My personality changed from a well-mannered child to someone who was angry, upset and felt abandoned. I experimented with cannabis at 13-years-old and my mum didn’t try to stop me.
My mum’s relationship with her husband deteriorated. Arguments would escalate and she became a victim of domestic violence. On numerous occasions she left to live in refuges, but she would return and the cycle of violence would continue. Eventually, we were housed in a ‘mother and baby’ unit when I was 14.
Over the next couple of years, my mum’s drinking got even worse. She dated various alcoholics and again suffered domestic violence. When I was 16, a bailiff knocked on our door one morning. Mum hadn’t been paying the rent on our flat and we were thrown out immediately. I sat outside the block of flats waiting but my mum never returned.
I had been banned from my father’s house by his partner so I had nowhere to go. I slept rough for a few nights before social services pointed me towards Step by Step (then called Emmaus Project). That was 10 years ago now."
"I don’t think I can ever put into words how much Step by Step supported me. They gave me structure, care and a sense of belonging. I had regular one-to-one’s with keyworkers which were pivotal in growing my confidence. At first, I was going through every emotion on a daily basis – feeling alone, betrayed, shocked, numb, sad, helpless, angry. But now I felt like I was being supported and coached by people who cared.
I started to develop confidence. I got a job and a sense of independence. I used that feeling of achievement and empowerment to fuel me and keep me going in the right direction. That has stayed with me ever since.
Today, I am an Associate Director for a global recruitment company.
I am extremely proud to have joined the board of trustees at Step by Step, meaning I am involved in deciding how the charity is run. It is very rare for someone helped by a charity to then become a trustee. I have the opportunity to shape our services to help young people in a similar position to I was when Step by Step helped me.”
I don’t think I can ever put into words how much Step by Step supported me.

Faheem's Story
"Patience, tolerance and belief in each and every young person we work with is the only way to challenge their distrust, hopelessness and disbelief in their abilities."
By Natasha Nazir,STEP Worker
I remember so vividly when Faheem* first arrived at Step by Step. I will never forget the expression on his face. His eyes and body language projected fear, uncertainty, distrust and confusion. He appeared tired and defeated, both in body and mind.
And why wouldn’t he? Faheem was an asylum-seeking child who had faced adversity and trauma beyond our understanding. He had lost control of his life and people were making decisions for him. He was disoriented, with people around him speaking a language he could not fully comprehend. He could not understand why he was being transferred from one place to another.
But Faheem persevered. Step by Step accommodation staff took it upon themselves to make him feel as comfortable as possible. We knew that the best way to support Faheem was to gain understanding of his culture, and his likes, dislikes and interests.
We knew that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach would not work for Faheem. Just as we adapted to his particular needs, Faheem adapted to his new surroundings and we all grew in knowledge, skill and confidence in accommodating one another.
Very soon Faheem started engaging in one-to-one activities with the support of staff, such as cooking the food he liked, playing table tennis, going out to explore the town centre and attending the local mosque. He started taking one-to-one English lessons, which helped improve his English speaking and comprehension remarkably. He found trust, love and empowerment; we discovered a smiling young person who has slowly but surely started to believe in his potential, ability and skills
Faheem is now a full-time student at a local college and studying English. It is such a delight to see him wave to us every morning when he leaves for college on his own, a young man growing in confidence.
He has now progressed to our Step 2 accommodation, which represents more independent living. He goes to the gym every day and now that he can express himself more easily, socialises with other young people accommodated with us. These are significant steps towards self-sufficiency.
I have worked with Faheem for around a year now and am humbled by his resilience, respect and gratitude for life’s little blessings. My heart fills with joy and admiration when I see him evolving every day.
And I’ve also learnt from him. He has taught me that with a little patience, love and understanding, you can make all the difference. It is not only about understanding the spoken words, but the silences as well. Patience, tolerance and belief in each and every young person we work with is the only way to challenge their distrust, hopelessness and disbelief in their abilities.
Faheem still has a long way to go. He will surely face more challenges in life, but I no longer see the fear, distrust and confusion in his eyes. I strongly believe that Step by Step has given him the opportunity, strength and the empowerment to face his challenges with calm and grace and we are all optimistic about his future.

Tara's Story
When her brother was diagnosed with cancer, Tara* had a lot to contend with, especially for someone just 20 years old. She felt that she should be close to her family and so moved back home.
However, her mum couldn’t cope with looking after Tara and her brother, and so asked Tara to leave. She found herself sleeping on friends’ sofas, not knowing where else to go and with no stability in her life. Tara had enjoyed working but wasn’t able to continue doing so with no permanent address. She had no money and no direction.
It is almost impossible for a young person in Tara’s position to privately rent. Not only would she have to earn enough to afford the rent, she would have to save for a deposit and have a guarantor. Young people find the system confusing and the prospect of living independently very daunting.
It was when she applied for Universal Credit, that Tara was told about Step by Step. We interviewed her to assess her needs and how we could best help. We were able to offer her a place in shared accommodation just two days later.
Tara was very anxious when she first moved in and kept to herself. Her Step Worker reassured her and was soon able to bring Tara out of her shell. Tara enjoyed having the support, knowing that there was always someone she could turn to for advice, mentoring or just a friendly chat.
Tara gained confidence, made new friends and became more comfortable within herself. She had the stability she needed and was delighted to be able to start working again.
Tara told us that if it were not for Step by Step, she would still be sleeping on friends’ sofas with no idea what to do next. Now she is hoping to soon achieve independent living, with the chances in life that most young people take for granted.

036 - Luca's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/lucas-story/

Luca's Story
When Luca* was referred to our Supported Lodgings service, he was struggling to get his life together and was without a permanent place to live.
His mother had evicted him from the family home following on-going arguments, largely centred around his cannabis misuse and behavioural issues. Luca went to live with his estranged father, but that didn’t work out either. The outcome was equally bleak following a placement with a local supported accommodation project, and Luca found himself sofa surfing with no stability and no prospect of addressing his drug misuse and other issues.
Children’s Services referred Luca to Step by Step’s Supported Lodgings service. We used our in-depth matching process to find the ideal Host for him to live with. This careful matching process is integral to the high success rate of our Supported Lodgings placements.
In this case, the Host we chose for Luca had significant experience of working with ex-offenders and young people with challenging behavioural issues. The Host lives in a rural location, which appealed to Luca as he aspires to be a game keeper. Both parties met via our viewing process and made clear their commitment to each other and what was expected from the placement.
We assessed Luca to establish his goals and aspirations, his strengths, and what he wanted to focus on achieving. We then made it clear what was expected of Luca to maintain his placement, what the boundaries were, and the consequences were he to cross those boundaries.
Luca got on well with his Host. He was able to build his confidence and self-esteem. The highly supportive and friendly home was very different from the volatile situation he had come from.
It was not all plain sailing. Luca continued his cannabis misuse, would come home very late and failed to keep his room tidy. Working alongside the Host, the experienced STEP Worker managed these issues in a calm and supportive manner. Step by Step have developed a structured process of continually reviewing placements, monitoring any issues and working with all parties to find resolutions. The young person knows they could be evicted if they fail to engage with this process.
The issues with Luca were addressed. He has stopped his drug misuse, improved his communication skills and keeps his room clean. Crucially, Luca is able to understand that all of this framework is in place to support him in making changes and improving his life, opportunities that were not available to him in previous placements.

Supported Lodgings gave me a roof over my head. The people I lived with made me feel completely comfortable and I can now call them family.

037 - Dora's Story

Dora's Story
Dora* found herself in an unimaginable situation when she arrived in the UK as a refugee. Following the death of her mother and brother at a young age, and with her father still in Zimbabwe, she had nowhere to call home.
Dora slept on a friend’s sofa while balancing a full-time job in a care home. She found herself moving around, living with various friends, with no permanent home and no stability in her life. Dora moved in with her aunt, but the relationship broke down and she found herself sofa surfing once again.
Dora came to Youth AIMS – based in our Aldershot headquarters – and the team helped her explore her housing options. They made a referral to our Step 1 accommodation, which has round-the-clock support available. Dora was ambitious and keen to succeed, her ultimate goal to join the army and become an Aircraft Technician.
After two months of living with Step by Step, Dora moved to Step 2 accommodation, which offers more independence. She engaged well with the services available to her, attending regular STEP sessions and joining in with cooking meals for everyone. She even visited schools and companies to talk about Step by Step. With her renewed confidence, Dora was able to find herself a job as a care assistant and started attending a gym to focus on her health and wellbeing.
Now that she has stable accommodation and the support of people who believe in her, Dora can start to work towards goals that had been out of reach while homeless.

Jack's Story
Jack* lived with his mum after they had to flee domestic abuse. A few years later, they moved abroad with his mum’s new partner. However, things did not go as planned and his mum’s relationship broke down. Finding themselves abroad with a lack of employment opportunities and affordable accommodation, they decided to return home to the UK.
Jack’s mum struggled to find permanent accommodation and so Jack was unable to live with her. He presented himself to our Youth AIMS drop-in advice service, based in our Aldershot Foyer, where he was able to receive support and look at the next steps available to him.
As well as having issues with substance abuse, Jack struggled with his mental health. He confessed that he had suicidal thoughts and had low self-esteem. After discussing the options available, Jack felt that supported accommodation would be good for him. As well as a safe, stable place to live, he would also be able to access counselling and have opportunities to learn life skills so that he could work towards independence.
Jack was referred to and accommodated in our Aldershot Foyer. He initially lived in Step 1 accommodation, which has support workers available 24/7 and is for young people with the most intensive needs. After a couple of months, Jack was showing enough signs of progression to be able to move on to Step 2, which encourages residents to live more independently.
While living with Step by Step, Jack attended our counselling service and was able to work on his self-esteem and mental health issues. He found himself growing in confidence. The group living environment and support from staff allowed him to learn life skills that would be the basis for a stable future.
Jack was able to move on from Step by Step accommodation and now lives independently.

Sam's Story
Sam* was made homeless when her mum asked her to leave the family home. She lived with her sister temporarily but it was never intended to be a long-term solution.
Our Supported Lodgings service was able to help Sam and she was paired with a Host. When she first moved in, Sam was very quiet and shy. However, she soon developed more confidence, responding well to the support she was offered and engaging well with the Host.
With her increased self-confidence, Sam was able to start work in a salon, while also working part-time in a clothes shop and studying Beauty Therapy at college. She worked hard and was able to pay for driving lessons, passing her test first time. She even managed to save up to buy a car. As she learned more life skills and self-sufficiency, she was able to pay her rent independently.
Sam followed the placement agreement and respected the Host’s house rules. She was flourishing and growing in confidence all the time.
However, things took a turn when Sam lost her job in the salon and gave up her other job to focus on her studies. Being left with no income made Sam very stressed and greatly impacted her mental wellbeing. The Step by Step support worker and the Host sat down with Sam to discuss how to resolve the situation. It was agreed that Sam would stay in placement until she found another job.
Sam gained her Level 3 Beauty Therapy qualification, and with help from her support worker and Host, she soon gained well-paid employment in a spa. She was able to pay her rent independently once more and grew in confidence again, pursuing a career she really enjoyed.
When Sam felt she was able to move on, she was supported in looking for private rental properties and found a flat that she liked. The council were able to support Sam with a contribution towards the deposit and first month’s rent.
Sam has now moved into her new flat. Although she is sad to be leaving her Host, she has come a long way from the shy girl lacking life skills and is excited about the next step in her life.

040 - Holly's Story
Source: https://www.stepbystep.org.uk/about-us/young-peoples-stories/hollys-story/

Holly's Story
Holly* was at risk of homelessness when her relationship with her parents broke down. She initially moved into Step by Step Foyer accommodation, but found it difficult to manage her emotional and mental health needs in a group living environment. Supported Lodgings was the ideal solution, offering Holly the stability she needed in a more family-like setting.
Holly was placed with an experienced Host in Fareham and settled in well. After a short time, she showed signs of greater emotional stability. With encouragement and support, Holly attended appointments with a local Mental Health service provider.
However, Holly eventually decided that these counselling sessions, and the medication she had been prescribed, were not a long term solution for her mental health issues. It was more important for her to be near her friends and the support of a social network. Because her friends lived some distance away, Holly was spending a lot of money and time on travelling to meet them.
Step by Step responded to this situation by finding Holly a new Host, this time in Gosport and within walking distance of her friends. Since then, Holly’s mental and emotional health have steadily improved. She is now happier and more grounded, and has started online courses studying various aspects of childcare which she hopes to pursue as a career.
Holly has fully settled in to her new Supported Lodgings home and feels safe and secure. Her new Host is very supportive, tolerant and understanding. Holly is already thinking about the next step of living independently, including looking for a part-time job and exploring private renting opportunities.
Step by Step Support Worker, Chris Furness, commented: “It's been a real pleasure to see how well Holly has progressed in the last 12 months. Her confidence and resilience have grown and she has made a really positive transition towards independence and adulthood.”
Holly still has some personal and life challenges to overcome, but she is making great progress and is much more positive about her future.

041 - Mia's Story

Mia's Story
Mia* had always had a difficult relationship with her mum. From the age of 13, she was regularly being kicked out of home and finding herself sofa surfing, moving from one friend to another. This put stress on her relationship with her friends, as well as causing a great deal of instability in her life.
When Mia turned 16, she was forced out for the final time and became homeless. She ended up living at a friend’s house. She wanted to return home but knew that she couldn’t. Mia’s social worker told her about Step by Step and made a referral.
“When I first moved in, I was nervous,” Mia recalls. “I don’t like change and this was a really big change for me.” However, Mia soon settled in to the Foyer accommodation and started to make friends.
As well as a safe place to live, Mia was able to access our other services. Her Step Worker helped to boost Mia’s self-esteem and taught her how to be independent. Mia had always wanted to go to college and then university, her ambition to become a counsellor for children who had suffered domestic violence. For the first time, Mia’s dreams seemed achievable.
“Step by Step has taught me that my past doesn't have to affect my future and anything I put my mind to I can achieve.”
With a brighter future ahead of her, Mia has a message for our supporters. “Thank you to the people that support Step by Step in helping me reach my goals in life.”
